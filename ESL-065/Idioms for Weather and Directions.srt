00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.080
Hello ESL 75 students, welcome to week 6 and the
next set of idioms. this week, we are going to ...

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.720
be working on weather and Direction idioms. there are 14.
that means 10 plus 4 more.

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.253
I'm going to go over each one in a little
bit more detail, so we can understand them a little ...

4
00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:20.616
better.

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.184
Of Course, during class, this upcoming week, I'll also explain
them while in person over Zoom. But I hope this ...

6
00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.074
video will be helpful for you.

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.020
So we're going to start with our very first weather
idiom. And it is, "clear the air". and when we ...

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.971
use the idiom "clear the air", what we're really talking
about is that there is some kind of problem between ...

9
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:51.571
ourselves, and the person we're speaking with, so maybe we
have had a very uncomfortable situation. there is some kind ...

10
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:57.353
of problem, and so when we say, "I want to
clear the air." that means, I want to make sure ...

11
00:00:57.353 --> 00:01:05.213
that we talk about this problem, that we're very uncomfortable
about, and hopefully by talking about the problem, we solve ...

12
00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:11.903
the problem. So its like the air is polluted, it's
bad air because the problem is present, and we're not ...

13
00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:17.035
talking about it. so the moment we clear up the
problem, and we find a solution.

14
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.711
It's like saying, that the air we now is clean.
we can breathe more easily. It is no longer uncomfortable ...

15
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:26.399
because the problem is gone.

16
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.320
Now,

17
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.495
Number two is a kind of person that we sometimes
have in our lives. Now, this is what we call ...

18
00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:34.879
"a fair weather friend"

19
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.564
If the weather is good, this friend is great. So
if everything is great in life, they are your best ...

20
00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:47.989
friend. The moment you have problems, Let's say, it's like
saying the weather is bad, then this friend is no ...

21
00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:54.714
longer your friend. They run away because they don't want
to deal with your problems, so they're only around when ...

22
00:01:54.714 --> 00:02:00.659
everything is good in life. they're not there for you
when you need them, so not a very good friend.

23
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.012
Number three "to be in the dark" means, Well, what
happens when you're in the dark and there's no light?

24
00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:15.585
in this case, it means instead of I can't see
anything, it means, I don't know anything. So, if somebody ...

25
00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:21.392
starts talking to you about a topic where you have
no idea, you can say, "I'm in the dark. I ...

26
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:23.817
don't know what you're talking about."

27
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.000
Because you have no clue, no idea.

28
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.054
Number 4. When it says, "it's raining cats and dogs."
that means you have very heavy rain. pretend like dogs ...

29
00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:42.283
are falling from the sky, and cats. you can imagine,
that would mean there's a lot of rain falling down ...

30
00:02:42.283 --> 00:02:49.122
at that point, so you might walk outside, and suddenly
it starts raining really really hard. you might say, "Wow!

31
00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:55.412
it's really raining cats and dogs outside." because it's really
falling,  a lot of rain is falling down.

32
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.360
Um,

33
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.645
If you say you're number 5, "on cloud nine" You're
a very happy person. something wonderful has just happened in ...

34
00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:10.584
your life, and you are so happy. And that would
mean, you feel like you're in heaven, and you're on ...

35
00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:15.977
a beautiful fluffy cloud, and it's something we would say
"on cloud nine "you're so happy.

36
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.201
Number 6, "to set somebody straight." Now, this is when
you give somebody advice, but you give it with a ...

37
00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:29.679
warning more like "mm mmm mm." Meaning, you think somebody
is doing something wrong

38
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.567
And You want to help them by telling them, "stop
doing this! this is wrong! this is bad! this will ...

39
00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:43.412
be bad for you!" usually, you can say this to
a family member, your children, good friends. Usually, you wouldn't ...

40
00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:47.934
say this to a stranger. it's for somebody you really
know very well and you

41
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.265
Care About them a lot, so you want them to
do the right thing. you don't want them to make ...

42
00:03:54.265 --> 00:04:01.019
huge mistakes in their life, and in this situation when
you want to "set somebody straight" it means, you think ...

43
00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.607
that they have gone down the wrong road in life,
so you want to set them back on the correct ...

44
00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:13.055
path, and so when we say "straight" That means, that's
the correct path, the correct Road in life, and you ...

45
00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:19.687
want to take them from going sideways to going back
straight and ahead. So that's "to set somebody straight."

46
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.280
Remember, only use it with people you really know well.

47
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.760
and care about.

48
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.942
Alright number 7, "to Feel under the weather" Now, when
you're feeling under the weather, you're feeling sick. You're like, ...

49
00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:38.802
"Achoo." and somebody says, "how are you feeling?" and you
say, "Oh today, I'm feeling under the weather. I think ...

50
00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:40.790
I have a fever. I don't feel so good."

51
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.703
That means, "to feel under the weather" you're feeling like,
it's raining. it's bad, and your health is not so ...

52
00:04:47.703 --> 00:04:47.972
good.

53
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.338
Number 8. "any port in the storm" Now, this is
something we talk about when we feel we're in a ...

54
00:04:56.338 --> 00:05:04.285
situation where we don't have many options, many choices. so,
we'll choose whatever is there, whatever option we have open.

55
00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:10.212
so for example, this comes from ships when we used
to travel more by ship. If a ship see the ...

56
00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:16.987
storm on the horizon, they know a storm is coming,
then they don't care as much about where they're going ...

57
00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:22.980
to hide from the storm. they're going to go to
any port, any place that they can to hide from ...

58
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.973
this terrible storm that is coming, and that is the
same thing with us in our lives. a lot of ...

59
00:05:28.973 --> 00:05:35.747
the time if you're in a situation where we don't
have many choices, we will choose whatever choice is the ...

60
00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:40.502
easiest at that very moment because we want to make
sure that we are safe.

61
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.720
Alright,

62
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.634
Going on to number 9. "as the crow flies" yes,
the crow is back again. last time, we talked about ...

63
00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:57.895
"eating crow" and now, we're going to talk more about
how we're going to talk about that same Blackbird again, ...

64
00:05:57.895 --> 00:06:00.293
but this time it's talking not about

65
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.162
Bad things, but it's just talking about, "how do I
get from one place to another the fastest way I ...

66
00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:15.941
can?" so we have to remember, birds can fly. We
unfortunately cannot unless of course we take an airplane. but ...

67
00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:21.794
it is course faster to fly than it is to
walk or drive, so if we say, "I'm going to ...

68
00:06:21.794 --> 00:06:28.859
go the way the crow flies" that really means, "I'm
going to get from one place to another as quickly ...

69
00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:36.067
as possible. to fastest route or this fastest way to
get to my destination." so you're not going to go ...

70
00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:41.134
the long way. you're going to go to the short
way. so you make it there.

71
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.800
quickly.

72
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.347
And That's generally how we use, "as the crow flies"
because then you're choosing the quickest way.

73
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.920
Now, Number 10.

74
00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:01.217
When something is "going south" that means, our situation is
getting worse. So if you say that for example, that ...

75
00:07:01.217 --> 00:07:08.817
your, let me see, that your husband  maybe is
having problems at work, and his boss is giving less ...

76
00:07:08.817 --> 00:07:16.888
and less work. you might say, "oh the situation is
going south" meaning, the situation is getting worse.

77
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.440
And it's usually a very negative kind of idiom.

78
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.656
Number 11, on the other way is when you say
something is full of "blue skies" or somebody is full ...

79
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:34.718
of ways to see the world in "Blue Skies" it
means, they see things a little too nicely. if you ...

80
00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:42.409
remember, when we did meeting people idioms, and we talked
about somebody "Whistling Dixie" where they see the world in ...

81
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:49.578
a little too positively, this is the same case, if
somebody thinks of everything as "Blue Skies" where there is ...

82
00:07:49.578 --> 00:07:56.226
no rain, and there is nothing else, then, they see
the world a little too positively. it's not close to ...

83
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:56.748
reality.

84
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:05.785
Numbrt 12 is "a bolt from the blue" this means,
something surprising and unexpected has happened in your life. just ...

85
00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:13.734
like seeing lightning come out of blue sky. there shouldn't
be anything, right? and this is something that is actually ...

86
00:08:13.734 --> 00:08:21.615
a natural phenomenon that sometimes does happen when people will
see lightning from miles away, but there is no cloud ...

87
00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:29.972
in the sky. So it's very surprising because usually thunder,
and lightning comes with storms, right? storm clouds, rain. but ...

88
00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:37.718
sometimes, it's very strange, but the weather happens where a
lightning bolt comes from 10 miles away, and there is ...

89
00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:44.172
a cloud, but it's way way over there, and you
say, "how is that possible? It was so surprising."

90
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:53.211
When you say this in life, you're usually saying that
you witnessed a situation where it was a huge surprise.

91
00:08:53.211 --> 00:09:00.721
you are very surprised that something happened, and so you
might say, "Wow! when my aunt Melda showed up on ...

92
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:07.311
my doorstep yesterday. it was a bolt from the blue.
I didn't expect her to come to my house. I ...

93
00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:09.294
had no idea she was coming."

94
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.847
And the last one that we have for this week
is, "The Calm before the storm" so, this is usually ...

95
00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:18.665
in a situation where we can

96
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:28.329
Predict that Something bad is going to happen soon in
the future, so that usually when these situations happen, there's ...

97
00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:36.467
usually...this is once again explaining weather phenomenon,  so usually,
if you're out on the sea or  near the ...

98
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:42.066
ocean, is usually very nice and calm, the water is
nice. there's a blue sky.

99
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.771
And then A storm comes in very quickly, and things
get bad, right? things get worse.

100
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.255
So when we say, "this was the Calm before the
storm" that means, this is the period of time before, ...

101
00:09:56.255 --> 00:10:02.410
you know, a big problem happens in my life or
a  very bad situation is about to happen. I ...

102
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:08.706
can see it coming from a from a little distance.
and I know it's going to get worse. so for ...

103
00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:15.700
example, let's say, you made a big mistake at work,
and that point it still hasn't come to your boss, ...

104
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:23.045
where your boss will find out what's actually happened, so
if your boss finds out, you know at that moment ...

105
00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:30.110
you're in trouble. so before that, you call that, "the
Calm before the storm" you know you can predict

106
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.520
That you will have a big problem coming very soon.

107
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:42.836
Alright, Well I hope this video helps you a little
bit, understand these idioms about weather and directions a little ...

108
00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:48.926
bit more. we will once again talk about this in
class this week, so I will hopefully see most of ...

109
00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:49.503
you then.

110
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.000
And if Not, you guys can watch the recording from
this week, so...

111
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.880
Thank you so much I hope this helps you.

112
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.520
And take care everyone. Bye.
