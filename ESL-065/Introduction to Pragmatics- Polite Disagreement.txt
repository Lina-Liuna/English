WEBVTT 1 00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.841 Hello ESL75 students and welcome back to more pragmatics for week 5. 2 00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.205 So, This time, I'm going to talk a little bit about asking for and giving directions. now, there is a ... 3 00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:19.595 polite way to do this. And yes, I know most of us have cell phones that give us GPS coordinates, ... 4 00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:26.253 so we don't get lost, but what if your cell phone dies? Then, you may have to use the old-fashioned, ... 5 00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:33.786 actually using your voice and you're speaking to ask for directions from a person. Now of course when were asking ... 6 00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:37.821 for directions that means, we don't know where something is. 7 00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.696 So when we formulate our question about directions, we want to be polite. 8 00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.320 We have pragmatics for this purpose. so, 9 00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.571 What's the first step? The first step is easy. We have to ask for directions. so we would usually say, ... 10 00:00:55.571 --> 00:01:02.917 "excuse me, can you tell me how to get to..." and then you're going to give your location. so let's ... 11 00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:07.265 say for example, your location that you want to find is the 12 00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.905 Movie theater, okay, in Concord. let's say you looking for the Brenden Movie Theater, and you've never been there before. 13 00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.598 Your cell phone's dead. you can't find it, and now you're going to ask a stranger on the street, and ... 14 00:01:20.598 --> 00:01:21.659 you say, "excuse me," 15 00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.252 Can you Please tell me where the Brenden Theater is located, please?" 16 00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.847 And now, The other person has three ways to answer you. 17 00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.899 If they know where this place is and they know where to get, how to get from where you are ... 18 00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.428 standing, and where the theater is, they can say, "yes, of course. Here are the directions." or they can just ... 19 00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:50.110 tell you, "yes, please make a left turn on this road, go straight for 2 miles, and then it's on ... 20 00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.077 the right side." 21 00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.720 For example. 22 00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.830 If They are not sure, it's a maybe, they can say, "I'm not sure, but I think it's over across ... 23 00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.495 two streets over." 24 00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.744 Or they can maybe pull out their own phone and check on their cell phone. And say, "okay, I think ... 25 00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:12.779 it's right here. Here's the Brenden Theater." Right? These days, I think that's easier. 26 00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.081 Or If they don't know at all, and they don't have a cell phone with them, they might say, ... 27 00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:24.502 "oh, you know, I don't have any idea. I'm new here. I don't live here. so, I'm so sorry I ... 28 00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:31.462 can't give you directions." so, you have three options as the person who's being asked. So, remember, all of those ... 29 00:02:31.462 --> 00:02:38.299 three situations it's polite. if you know, you can give clear directions. if you're not sure, let them know that ... 30 00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.147 you're not sure, but you think 31 00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.480 You will say, "I think it is this way." 32 00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.041 And if you have no idea, you can say, "oh, I'm sorry. I don't live here. or "I have no ... 33 00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.527 idea. I wish I could help you, but I can't." 34 00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.400 And that way, it is polite in three different ways. 35 00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.456 So, I hope you will use this information when you are working on your homework this week. Alright, good luck ... 36 00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:02.999 everyone.
