#### 4. Formal vs. Informal Speech
https://youtu.be/zbKLghk2eFg
Have you ever thought about the difference between "Hello" and "Hi"?  "Hello" is slightly more formal in English.
If you go to a job interview or your first day of work, you would say "Hello" to the people there--not "Hi." 
With your close friends, you would say "Hi."  For classmates and people in public, it can get a bit tricky.  
California tends to be less formal than many other states, so saying "Hi" to your teacher or classmates is acceptable.
The first time you meet someone or send them an email, you should use "Hello" and then see how they answer back.  
Once the other person uses "Hi," it's usually okay to use "Hi" with them after that.
In addition to our word choice, there are other differences between formal and informal speech. 
There's nothing wrong with sounding formal, but sometimes it seems a bit unusual.  
Even when we are in formal situations, we don't pronounce all of the sounds in English.  
This is a great video that shows you how to sound more natural.

#### 5. Introduce Yourself
1) What name do you prefer to go by?  ("To go by" is an idiom that means to be called a certain name.)
2) What brought you to DVC?  
   1) ("What brought you" or "What brings you" is an idiom that means what are your reasons for doing something?)
3) What's something you like about US culture?
4) What's something you don't like about US culture?
5) What's something you like about your home culture?
6) Add anything else you want to tell the class.

#### 6. Pronouns and Possessive Adjectives

### Unit 3
#### 7. Phrasal verbs
Phrasal verbs are verbs that are made of more than one word.  
There is usually a root to a main verb and then an extra word or words that completely change the meaning of the root word.  
For example, the word hang means this:
But when "hang" is joined with other small words, the meaning changes. 
Here are some examples:
hang up
hang out

#### 8. The -tion Noun Ending
By now, you probably know that many nouns end in -tion in English.  Here are a few helpful hints about the -tion ending.
I.  Most -tion nouns in English are a combination of a verb + the -tion ending.  Here are some examples:
      subtract + -tion = subtraction
      vacate  + -tion = vacation
      explain + -tion = explanation   (Sometimes there is a spelling change.)

II.  The syllable before the -tion is almost always the stressed syllable.  Let's look at and listen to our example words:
     subtraction = sub-TRAK-shun
     vacation = vei-KEI-shun
     explanation = ex-pla-NEI-shun

### Unit 4
#### 10. Pronunciation Practice: schwa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syX-07rhxoE
In some of our pronunciation videos, you may have heard the word "schwa." 
The word "schwa" is very strange.  If you ask a native speaker what it means, they probably won't know, 
but it is the most common sound in American English.
Watch this video to learn more about the all-important schwa!
Schwa happens in unstressed syllables.
The syllable is reduced and said quickly.
Schwa is relaxed.  (Kind of like "uh.")  There is no tension.
Any vowel letter can be the schwa sound.

#### 11. Vocabulary #1: Using a Thesaurus
Many people believe that using a dictionary will help them increase their vocabulary--well, maybe. 
But there's a better tool to help remind you of the words you already know and to teach you new words.
That tool is a thesaurus.  A dictionary gives you a definition, but a thesaurus gives you a list of words that are similar. 
The similar words are called synonyms.
You can use a book called a thesaurus, but there's a perfectly good website called, simply, 
Thesaurus.com Links to an external site.
https://www.thesaurus.com/

#### 12. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 1, what a syllable is?
Many students worry about pronouncing individual sounds, but word stress is more important than pronouncing sounds exactly. 
But before we focus on word stress, we have to remember what a syllable is.

Watch this for a quick review of what a syllable is. 
https://youtu.be/sqHRA5_AreY
Stressed syllables receive emphasis and full pronunciation; they are often louder.
The number of vowel sounds within a word determines the number of syllables.

#### 13. Verb Endings (Suffixes)
Verbs can be tricky in English.  Sometimes they have suffixes; sometimes they don't.  
It helps to learn some common verb suffixes because you can identify and learn new verbs by recognizing these suffixes and how they are usually pronounced.
Here are some common verb endings and some examples with them. 
(The usual stress pattern is shown, but, of course, with English, there are many exceptions.)
https://youtu.be/qwrw5OUwRbk

#### 14. Speaking Introducing Yourself 
We often have to introduce ourselves, and no matter how many times we do it, for many people, it can make us nervous. 
One of the best practices for feeling more comfortable speaking is practice. 
If you have a formalized introduction of yourself that you have written and practiced, 
then when you are asked to introduce yourself, you will feel more confident.
This will come in handy when you are at a job interview.
This is a speaking assignment, but if it helps you to write it out first and then read it, that's fine. 
For this assignment, speak for two minutes introducing yourself.
Because this is practice for an interview, we'll begin with the word "Hello" rather than "Hi." 
Be sure to tell your me your name and where you're from.  This could be your home country or where you live now.
Consider the following questions, but also add anything you think is interesting or useful to know about you:
What is your work experience?
What is your education experience?
What special skills do you have?  (Don't forget that you are bilingual.  That is extremely valuable!)
What hobbies do you have?
What goals do you have?

### Unit 5
#### 15. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 2
https://youtu.be/XASBN5uMdEk
Stressed syllables receive emphasis and full pronunciation; they are often louder and last longer. 
(Helpful tip:  For words ending in -ion, the stress is almost always on the syllable right before the ion. 
For example, information =  in-fer-MEI-shuhn.)

#### 16. Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 1
Here's a good one.  Be sure to watch the whole thing!  (No, there won't be a quiz on this, but be sure not to skip over this--"r" is the hardest sound to make in English.)

(This sound can also be found on the American IPA Chart Links to an external site.as the "r" for "rabbit.")
https://americanipachart.com/
https://youtu.be/3XRTN5gW4oU

#### 17. Word Forms: Adjectives
The phrases "word forms" and "suffixes" are closely related.  Word forms tell us the part of speech of a word. 
Suffixes are word endings that tell us the part of speech of a word.  Not all words in English have suffixes. 
Many nouns and verbs do not.  However, many adjectives and adverbs do.

Please watch this video on word forms.  It covers the suffixes for several parts of speech. 
(Ignore any references to a book.  It was made when I still used books for my classes.  Also, ignore the unit number.)  
In this unit, we will be focusing on adjectives.

https://youtu.be/-6fomRuV_z0
https://youtu.be/R4vl1H0vdK4

### Unit 6
#### 18. Pronunciation Practice: "o" as in "Rose"
"O" is a sound that most of you have in your native language.  
Did you know that in English, the "o" sound is actually two vowel sounds together? 
We don't just say "o" in English--we say "o" with a rounded "u" sound at the end. 
Working on this sound will help you with clarity in many of your words.

https://youtu.be/w7O08xhdH0Q

### 19. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 3
https://youtu.be/dQ4rUdsh_hQ
https://www.merriam-webster.com/
https://www.dictionary.com/
Here are two good online dictionaries:  Meriam Webster  site.and Dictionary.com . 
Type in any word (like "apple") and notice how they show the syllable stress in different ways.

### 20. Word Forms: Adverbs
Word forms tell us the part of speech of a word. Suffixes are word endings that tell us the part of speech of a word.
Not all words in English have suffixes.
Many nouns and verbs do not. However, many adjectives and adverbs do.

One of the easiest suffixes to remember is the most common suffix for adverbs: -ly. 

Now that we know the form of adverbs and some exceptions, it helps to know what an adverb is! 
An adverb can have one of these three functions:
1). it modifies a verb
2). it modifies an adjective
3). it modifies another adverb.

I remember this by looking at the word "adverb" itself. 
First, there is the "ad" at the beginning of the word--that reminds me that adverbs can modify adjectives.
Then I look at the end of the word "verb"--that's an easy one; that reminds me that adverbs can modify verbs.
Then I look at the whole word--"adverb"--and that reminds me that adverbs can modify verbs.
Here some example sentences:

He is extremely tall.              (Here, "extremely" is an adverb modifying the adjective "tall.")
He walks slowly.                    (Here, "slowly" is an adverb modifying the verb "walks.")
He walks very slowly.           (Here, "very" is an adverb modifying the adverb "slowly.")

https://youtu.be/L0USJe44yS4

https://youtu.be/eRoL9YJa0lQ
bird work concur reverse over teacher mother her later perhaps turn stir journey

#### 25. Pronunciation Practice: Intonation
There are a few terms in pronunciation that are often confused.  These are "stress," "tone," and "intonation." 
In simple terms, here are their definitions:
1). Stress refers to syllable stress in a word, meaning how long and how loud the syllable is said.
2). Tone refers to the pitch of a word or syllable, meaning how high or low the word or syllable is said.
3). Intonation refers to the pitch of words across a sentence, such as whether certain words or syllables rise or fall.
Here are two great videos that demonstrate intonation for questions and clarification.
https://youtu.be/Aoj4HZlLQBY
https://youtu.be/GFwxtdhNZJw
Did you go to the party? /What did you bring to the party? /Did you pick up the groceries? /Does the store open at one?
Can you lend me a dollar? /How are you? /Why did you leave? /Where are the keys? /Who are you calling? /Which one did you buy?
Can I borrow your book? /Where's your book? /Did you go to the show? /How was the show? /Did you see Amanda? /When did you see Amanda?
What? /Pardon? /I beg your pardon? /I'm sorry? /I'm sorry. /Come again. /I didn't understand.  Could you repeat that? /I didn't catch that.

#### 26. Word Order: SVOMPT
You've probably heard that the word order in English is the following:  Subject + Verb + Object.  We sometimes abbreviate that to SVO.  
There's even more to word order than that.  Have you heard of SVOMPT?  It stands for Subject + Verb + Object + Manner (how) + Place + Time.

https://youtu.be/Oqgpxz4fXEI
"elbow grease"
After a bit of elbow grease, my kitchen shine and sparkle again.
#### 30. Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 3
https://youtu.be/WMkrolnBMPg

#### 31. Simple Present
Do you know the top five most common errors of non-native speakers?  You probably won't be surprised to know what they are:
1). articles
2). prepositions
3). subject-verb agreement with third person in simple present
4). verb form
5). word choice
We're going to focus now on the one that happens every day--#3--the missing "s" on the simple present verb with the third person.
The main uses of the simple present:
to express something that happens regularly:
      I always eat breakfast.         She eats a lot of candy.
to express a fact:
       Omnivores eat meat and plants.
       Vegetarians don't eat meat.
to speak about a movie, book, or story:
       Romeo loves Juliet.
       Shakespeare writes, "Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it."

The simple present IS NOT expressed when speaking about "right now."
Right now, I am taking an ESL class.   (Not:  Right now, I take an ESL class.)

#### 32: Voiced and Voiceless Sounds
https://youtu.be/XNrloK1KA0c
All sounds in English are either voiced or voiceless.  "Voiced" means that your throat vibrates when you make the sound; 
"voiceless" means that your throat doesn't vibrate when you make the sound. 
You can feel the vibration by touching your throat or the top of your head when you make the sound.

There are more sounds in the English language than there are in the alphabet, 
but here is a rough guide for which sounds are voiced and which are voiceless:
First, all vowels are voiced:  a, e, i, o, and u.

#### 33: Pronunciation Practice: "s" endings
When we use the "s" on the simple present tense third-person singular verbs (for "he," "she," "it," and other singular nouns), 
the "s" sound follows the same rule as it does for other words.
There are three ways to pronounce the final "s" sound, whether it's on verbs or other parts of speech:
1). "s"
2). "z"
3). "ihz"
For "s" before voiceless letters, the sound is a pure "s" sound.
For "s" before voiced letters, the sound is a pure "z" sound.
For "s" before other sounds that are like "s," the sound is an "ihz" sound.  (Like silver "i" with a "z.")

Here are some verbs for each category:
eats, lacks, helps, laughs
plays, loves, begs, smells
kisses, sneezes, catches, washes
https://youtu.be/hde9Sg75Nn4

#### 34. Pronunciation Practice: Contractions
You may hear that you should not use contractions in English. That is absolutely incorrect!  
We use contractions all the time in our speaking.  It used to be that you couldn't use them in your academic writing, but even that rule is changing.  
For now, avoid contractions in your writing, but do use them in speaking.  You will sound much more natural in your speaking if you do.
What are contractions?  They are the shortening of two words by combining them.  
When we combine them, we delete at least one letter and replace it with an apostrophe in writing.
Here is a clear explanation, and below it are some common examples. 
These examples include some that are accepted in writing and some that are not.  
They are all accepted in speaking.

### Unit 9
#### 37. Pronunciation Practice: black "a"
Here is a sound that may not exist in your native language.  
(If your native language is Persian, you can probably make this sound easily because it is one of the few languages like English that has this sound.)
This sound is often called "short a," but it is better described as the "a" in "black cat" on The Color Vowel Chart Links to an external site..
black "a" (not "red" and not "olive")
1). Drop your jaw!
2). Pull back your lips (like you're smiling!)
https://youtu.be/QJd5c1T1t-w
"hand in"separable :The first thing I need to do after I wake up this morning is hand in my Phrasal Verbs # 3 homework, because I forgot to finished it last night.

#### 38. Pronunciation Practice: "th"
"th":  This is probably the third hardest sound to make!  
Here's Keenyn again in a great video on how to pronounce "th" in English 
(but I disagree with how she pronounces "with"--I think it should be voiced.)
https://youtu.be/BBSU6A-CRx0

#### 39. Simple Present Negative Sentences with "Be"
To form negative sentences in the simple present tense with "to be" verbs, we simply add the word "not."  
We can shorten this by using contractions.  (Notice how the "I" contraction form is different from the others.)
Clear here to practice this form:

#### 40. Simple Present Negative Sentences with Other Verbs

### Unit 11
#### 52. Pronunciation Practice: "w" vs. "v"
Here's a great video on "w" vs. "v."  For "w," remember that the teeth do not touch the lips.  For "v," they do.
https://youtu.be/7PavwYaxcZA

#### 53.Grammar: Simple Past Tense
"Be" Verbs with Positive Sentences

The simple past tense is similar to the simple present tense because 
it has different rules for the verb "be," which becomes "was" or "were."
Here's how to make the positive with the "be" verb:
I was cold/you were tired./He was in the garden./She was late./It was sunny./We were on vacation/
They were hungry./

Other Verbs with Positive Sentences:
We usually make the positive by adding "-ed'"to the infinitive. For example, "play" becomes "played." However,
there are some irregular verbs Links to an external site..   For example, "go" becomes "went" and "run" becomes "ran."

#### 54. Pronunciation Practice: -ed Endings
o form the simple past tense, we add -ed to regular verbs. 
Since this isn't a grammar class, we won't go into all of the exceptions with irregular verbs.

However, that -ed rule can still be confusing because there are three ways to pronounce the -ed ending. 
We need to understand two ideas:  one is voicing; the other is a syllable.  We've already gone over voicing.  
You probably have learned about syllables, but watch the first video below for a review, and then watch the second video to understand how the -ed endings are pronounced.
https://youtu.be/sqHRA5_AreY
Here's a great video about how to pronounce -ed endings.  Be sure not to skip over this. 
Our second quiz will be on -ed endings.  This is a very common error with non-native speakers.
https://youtu.be/SjKqgujaeWE
RULES for -ed endings:

1) If a verb ends in a "t" or "d" sound and you add -ed, then there is an extra syllable that sounds like "did."
     shift --> shifted (shif-did)
     end   --> ended (en-did)
     avoided --> a/voi/did  (3 syllables)
2) If a verb ends in a vowel sound or a voiced consonant sound, then it ends in a -d sound with no extra syllable.
play --> played (Both words are one syllable.)    

love --> loved (Both words are one syllable.)
3) If a verb ends in a voiceless consonant sound, then it ends in a  -t sound with no extra syllable.
 wash --> washed (washt)   (one syllable)

#### 55. Keeping a Conversation Going
Do you find that you are more shy in English than in your native language?  That's a very common experience for many people.  
This video covers a tool for how to keep a conversation going:  asking open-ended questions rather than yes-no questions. 
Keep this in mind because we will have some practice on this in the next unit.

#### 59. Simple Past Negative Sentences with Other Verbs
To form negative sentences in the simple past tense with other verbs, 
we need "not" and the helping verb "did." What's nice is with the simple past, all negative verbs take "did."  
We can shorten these, also, by using contractions.

### Unit 13
#### 62. Pronunciation Practice: wooden "u"
And now for a strange sound, wooden "u."  This is a common challenge because it is not present in most other languages.
It's not "u" as in "blue."
It's relaxed like schwa.
Round your lips a bit, but less than blue "u."
The tongue is lower than in "blue."
https://youtu.be/QtYIp5KYk0M

#### 63. Vocabulary #4: Prefixes
We've learned about suffixes, which can tell us the part of speech in English.  
Now we'll learn some common prefixes.
Prefixes are pieces of words that appear at the beginning.  
They don't tell us the part of speech.  Rather, they change the meaning of words.
Step 1:  Listen to and watch the video.  (20 minutes, 18 seconds)
Step 2:  For practice, repeat each word after you hear it in the video.
Step 3:  Write the meaning for each of the prefixes listed below. (Please number them 1 through 32.)
https://youtu.be/9O4jGeSAByE

#### 64. Simple Past Questions with "Be"
To make a question in the simple past, just like the simple present, 
we change the position of "was" or "were" and the subject.

Here are the simple past "yes/no" questions with "be":
Was I sleepy?
Were you late?
Was he at the movies?
Was she kind?
Was it hot?
Were we hungry?
Were they at work?
With the "wh'" questions with "be," the question word just goes at the beginning, and everything else is the same.
Why was I sleepy?
Where were you?
When was he at the movies?
How was she?
How was it?
Why were we hungry?
When were they at work?

#### 65. Politely Disagreeing
Have you ever been stuck in a conversation without knowing how to disagree with someone politely?  
Now you will read a list of ways to disagree with someone
Choose two of your favorite ways from the list that you think you would like to use in the future. 
All you need to do is copy two appropriate sentences or phrases from the list.

https://www.speakconfidentenglish.com/disagree-in-english/
The most polite way to disagree with someone is to use one of these strategies when 
introducing your disagreement:
 show that you understand the other person’s opinion
 
apologize before introducing your disagreement

 pretend to be in the middle or unsure about your position
Using these strategies helps to soften the disagreement and make your position or 
argument more effective. 
 I see what you’re saying but I think...

 I respect your point but from my perspective (or but in my opinion)...

 I take your point but that isn’t the way I see it; instead, I think that...
 
True, that is a fair point, but I have to say I disagree...

 I understand where you are coming from but...

 There is some truth to what you’re saying but don’t you think that...
 
I’m sorry but I have to disagree with you on...
 
I’m not sure I agree with you on...
 
I don’t think you and I have the same opinion on this issue.

I’m afraid I disagree.

I’m sorry but I don’t agree.

I don’t see it that way.

I’m sorry but I disagree with you on this.

I respectfully disagree.

I have a completely different opinion on that.

practiced the meaning and pronunciation of 32 prefixes in English.
formed questions in the simple past with "be" verbs.
learned how to disagree with someone politely in English.

### Unit 14
#### 67. Pronunciation Practice: gray "a"
Here is a common sound that may exist in your native language. 
It's often called "long a," but it is better described as the "a" in "gray day" on The Color Vowel Chart Links to an external site.. 
It is a diphthong--which is a fancy word that means "two vowels together"--so it sounds more like "ei."
https://youtu.be/XOuD6mFr6sQ
say pay driveway okay play operate gain separate pain  

#### 68. Group Discussion Unit 14
Consider the two sentences below.  Which sentence do you agree with, and why? 
Write two to three sentences explaining your opinion.  
I'll go first with my opinion.  (You do not have to agree with me!)
A)  Kindness is more important than honesty.
B)  Honesty is more important than kindness.

Teacher's answer:
I believe honesty is more important than kindness.  Although I believe kindness is very important,
I would rather know the truth about something and make my own decision rather than have someone hide it from me. 
I believe that even when news is bad, we can deliver it kindly to someone.
Lina's answer:
I believe honesty is more important than kindness. 
I believe honesty is the top foundation of the trust and honest is the most important characteristics in creating strong relationships with others. 
I can totally trust in another person if our relationship is based on honesty. 
I believe being honesty means self-respect and respect for truly friends. 
Although kindness is also important to us, but honesty is the basic foundation, and without the basic foundation, kindness is meaningless. 

#### 69. Simple Past Yes/No Questions with Other Verbs
o make a yes/no question in the simple past with verbs other than "to be,"

#### 71. Linking Consonants to Vowels
Linking is my favorite skill to teach because I believe it is the greatest skill you can acquire to improve your fluency and pronunciation.  
When you first hear about linking, it sounds very strange. 
It takes practice; however, it will not only improve your speaking skills but your listening comprehension skills as well.
Watch this video to learn about linking, and we'll start with the first kind of linking:  consonants to vowels
https://youtu.be/5MsVp0L5kKg
I have a lot of apples.
I ate a lot of apples.
I love apples, and I love bananas.
I love apples.  Although I love them, I don't eat many.
That is the history of apples.
All apples have a common ancestor.

#### 73. Simple Past "Wh" Questions with Other Verbs
To make a "wh" question in the simple past with verbs other than "to be," 
put the "wh" question word and "did" before the subject and the base form of the verb after it.
Here are the "wh" questions for verbs other than "be":

#### 74. Group Discussion Unit 15
Last week you considered two value-based statements.  Now we will get a bit more controversial.
Consider the two sentences below.  Which sentence do you agree with, and why?  
Write at least two to three sentences explaining your opinion.  
I know each sentence has many points to discuss, so discuss those points!
A)  The government should raise taxes to spend more money on helping people.
B)  The government should lower taxes on people and companies to stimulate the economy.

Lina Liu
Nov 26, 2022Nov 26 at 12:18pm
I agree with sentence B), because currently we experience economic weakness in 2022. 
So our government need to lower taxes to stimulate the economy by boosting spending. 
I believe what our government need to do first is to lower the personal income taxes to encourage individuals to work, save, and invest. 
And lower taxes will ultimately lead to a larger economy.  
And only after our economy speed up and economy grow in an idea level, we can consider sentence A), 
currently sentence B) is more suitable for our society.

#### 75. Politely Interrupting
Have you ever been stuck in a conversation without knowing how to interrupt someone?  
Read these eleven ways to interrupt someone politely,
and then copy one here that you want to try the next time you are in this situation.
11 Ways to Interrupt Someone Politely in English
(from Speak Confident English:  link to site)
When you need to deliver a message:
I hate to interrupt, but I wanted to let you know I have to leave the meeting early.
I’m so sorry to interrupt, but...
I don’t mean to be rude, but may I interrupt quickly?
 
When you need to end a conversation
I’m terribly sorry to interrupt you, but I have to be at work for a meeting shortly 
and must *get going*. It was wonderful to see you. Have a nice day. (Note: In this 
context, to get going means to depart or leave.)
Oh! Sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed the time, and I need to get to work. I’m 
very sorry. But it was great chatting with you.
When you need to ask a question or would like to clarify something:
Sorry to interrupt, but may I ask a quick question?
I’m so sorry for interrupting, but I’d like to make sure I understood you correctly.
I don’t mean to be rude, but I’d like to ask a question.
 
When you want to join a conversation or express your opinion:
So sorry to interrupt, but before we *move on*, I’d like to add my thoughts on this 
topic. (Note: to move on means to start doing or discussing something new.)
Excuse me, but may I jump in here?
May I add something quickly?

### Unit 16
#### 78. The End of the Semester!
This is our last unit of the semester, so you're probably wondering what happens next.
Our last day of class is technically this Friday, December 9.  I will have just two business days to turn in grades, 
so if there is something you want to turn in or re-do, you have until Tuesday, December 13, at 11:59 PM to do so.  After that, it is out of my hands.
If you are in the credit class, I will email you with your grade.  If you have an "A," there is nothing else you need to do.  
If you have less than an "A," I will give you suggestions for how to raise your grade.
If you are in the non-credit class, you will not be receiving a grade. 
Remember that you can take this class again next semester or choose to move on to ESL-95.
You will have access to the Canvas course until January 9, so feel free to download any of your work or the material in the course up until that date.  
This would be a good time to look at your personal discussion board again and download any resources that will help you for the next classes you take.
On a side note, my computer had some issues this weekend, so I couldn't post the last quiz.  
As a result, there are only three quizzes for this class.  I hope that means good news for you!
As always, let me know if you have any questions.
I've enjoyed working with you and hope that you have a peaceful winter break!

#### 79. Linking Vowels to Vowels
If you thought linking consonants to vowels was weird, wait till you hear this:  linking vowels to vowels. 
But trust me--this will help you sound more like a native speaker, speak faster, read faster, and understand native speakers better.

https://youtu.be/BxZjJLichuY
This is easier when you see a consonant linked before a vowel.

I ate a lot of apples.
During that time, many churches, homes, black businesses were bombed. 
It was like part of life.  It was a part of living and growing up in the South.  
But when I heard about the shooting in the church in South Carolina, I began to shake, I began to cry.  
It just came out of me because it stays within you.  And it's almost like here is this link, another link of, ah, death.  
And the question is when will we break this link?

#### 80. Future Tense: Part 1
Now that we are at the end of the semester, it's fitting that we look ahead to the future by looking at the future tense.
Did you know there are three common ways to express the future tense in English?  
We'll look at the first way first:  using "will."
This may be the first form taught, but keep in mind that it is not the most common.  
This form is used for expressing promises.  We can also use "be + going to" for the future tense.  
"Be + going to" is for a plan, not a promise.  For example, if someone asked me, 
"What are your doing this weekend?" I would say, "I'm going to visit my cousins" because that is my plan.  
However, if my mother asks me, "When are you going to do your homework?" I would say,
"I will do it right now" because I am promising her.  We can also use "will" if we are very sure about the future.

Here's the positive form for a promise (it's just "will"+ the base form):
Positive Form	Contracted Form
I will meet him later.	I'll meet him later.
You will come.	You'll come.
It will be ready on time.	It'll be ready on time.
She will be there.	She'll be there.
He will help us.	He'll help us.
We will get married soon.	We'll get married soon.
They will cook dinner.	They'll cook dinner.

The short form, 'll, is very, very common and is almost always used when speaking. 
It's really much more natural to say "I'll" instead of "I will."  
Here's some help with the pronunciation of "we'll":
https://youtu.be/jTfPWknbm7A

Next, here's the negative form (just add "not"; for the contraction, "will not" becomes "won't"):
Negative Form	Contracted Form
I will not meet him later.	I won't meet him later.
You will not come.	You won't come.
It will not be ready on time.	It won't be ready on time.
She will not be there.	She won't be there.
He will not help us.	He won't help us.
We will not get married soon.	We won't get married soon.
They will not cook dinner.	They won't cook dinner.

Here's a tip on how to pronounce "won't."
https://youtu.be/Z8zVS8S7s28
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future-exercise-1.html

Finally, here's the question form for yes/no questions:
Will I go?
Will you come early?
Will it be cold?
Will she dance?
Will he arrive soon?
Will we cook?
Will they leave?
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future-exercise-2.html

And for "wh" questions:
Where will I go?
Why will you come early?
When will it be cold?
Who will she dance with?
What time will he arrive?
What will we cook?
When will they leave?
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future-exercise-3.html

#### 81. Future Tense: Part 2
More common than the "will" form of the future tense is the use of "be + going to + base form."  
This is used when we are speaking in general about a plan or intention for the future.
Here's the positive form for a plan or intention (it's just "going to"+ the base form):
Positive Form	Contracted Form
I am going to meet him later.	I'm going to meet him later.
You are going to come.	You're going to come.
It is going to be ready on time.	It's going to be ready on time.
She is going to be there.	She's going to be there.
He is going to help us.	He's going to help us.
We are going to get married soon.	We're going to get married soon.
They are going to cook dinner.	They're going to cook dinner.

The words "going to" in speaking are said very quickly and sound like "gonna."  
Be careful--do not write "gonna"--but do say it.  Here is a video that explains the pronunciation.
https://youtu.be/nptBj44Aj7A

Next, here's the negative form (just add "not"; for the contraction):
Negative Form	Contracted Forms
I am not going to meet him later.	I'm not going to meet him later.
You are not going to come.	
You're not going to come.  OR
You aren't going to come.
It is not going to be ready on time.	It's not going to be ready on time.   OR
It isn't going to be ready on time.
She is not going to be there.	
She's not going to be there.       OR
She isn't going to be there.
He is not going to help us.	
He's not going to help us.     OR
He isn't going to help us.
We are not going to get married soon.	
We're not going to get married soon.  OR
We aren't going to get married soon.
They are not going to cook dinner.	
They're not going to cook dinner.     OR
They aren't going to cook dinner.

Finally, here's the question form for yes/no questions:
Am I going to go?
Are you going to come early?
Is it going to be cold?
Is she going to dance?
Is he going to arrive soon?
Are we going to cook?
Are they going to leave?

And for "wh" questions:
Where am I going to go?
Why are you going to come early?
When is it going to be cold?
Who is she going to dance with?
What time is he going to arrive?
What are we going to cook?
When are they going to leave?

practice when to use "will" and when to use "be + going to."
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/support-files/will_or_be_going_to.pdf

#### 82. Future Tense: Part 3
About as common as "be + going to+ base form" for the future tense is the use of the present progressive (or present continuous).  
This is also used when we are speaking in general about a plan or intention for the future.
Here's the positive form for a plan or intention using the present progressive/continuous:
Positive Form	Contracted Form
I am meeting him later.	I'm meeting him later.
You are coming tomorrow.	You're coming tomorrow.
It is raining tomorrow.	It's raining tomorrow.
She is going soon.	She's going soon.
He is helping us.	He's helping us.
We are getting married soon.	We're getting married soon.
They are cooking dinner tonight.	They're cooking dinner tonight.
The -ing ending can be tricky to pronounce.  Here is a great explanation on how to pronounce "-ing":
https://youtu.be/iqW6NZmRzYI
Next, here's the negative form (just add "not"):
Negative Form	Contracted Forms
I am not meeting him later.	I'm not meeting him later.
You are not coming tomorrow.	
You're not coming tomorrow.  OR
You aren't coming tomorrow.
It is not raining tomorrow.	It's not raining  tomorrow.   OR
It isn't raining tomorrow.
She is not going soon.	
She's not going soon.       OR
She isn't going soon.
He is not helping us.	
He's not helping us.     OR
He isn't helping us.
We are not getting married soon.	
We're not getting married soon.  OR
We aren't getting married soon.
They are not cooking dinner tonight.	
They're not cooking dinner tonight.     OR
They aren't cooking dinner tonight.

Finally, here's the question form for yes/no questions:
Am I meeting him later?
Are you coming early?
Is it raining tomorrow?
Is she going soon?
Is he arriving soon?
Are we cooking tonight?
Are they leaving soon?

And for "wh" questions:
Where am I meeting him?
Who are you coming with?
When is it raining tomorrow?
Why is she going soon?
What time is he arriving?
What are we cooking tonight?
How are they leaving tomorrow?
