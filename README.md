#### 4. Formal vs. Informal Speech

Have you ever thought about the difference between "Hello" and "Hi"?  "Hello" is slightly more formal in English.
If you go to a job interview or your first day of work, you would say "Hello" to the people there--not "Hi." 
With your close friends, you would say "Hi."  For classmates and people in public, it can get a bit tricky.  
California tends to be less formal than many other states, so saying "Hi" to your teacher or classmates is acceptable.
The first time you meet someone or send them an email, you should use "Hello" and then see how they answer back.  
Once the other person uses "Hi," it's usually okay to use "Hi" with them after that.
In addition to our word choice, there are other differences between formal and informal speech. 
There's nothing wrong with sounding formal, but sometimes it seems a bit unusual.  
Even when we are in formal situations, we don't pronounce all of the sounds in English.  
This is a great video that shows you how to sound more natural.

#### 5. Introduce Yourself
1) What name do you prefer to go by?  ("To go by" is an idiom that means to be called a certain name.)
2) What brought you to DVC?  
   1) ("What brought you" or "What brings you" is an idiom that means what are your reasons for doing something?)
3) What's something you like about US culture?
4) What's something you don't like about US culture?
5) What's something you like about your home culture?
6) Add anything else you want to tell the class.

### Unit 3
#### 7. Phrasal verbs
Phrasal verbs are verbs that are made of more than one word.  
There is usually a root to a main verb and then an extra word or words that completely change the meaning of the root word.  
For example, the word hang means this:
But when "hang" is joined with other small words, the meaning changes. 
Here are some examples:
hang up
hang out

#### 8. The -tion Noun Ending
By now, you probably know that many nouns end in -tion in English.  Here are a few helpful hints about the -tion ending.
I.  Most -tion nouns in English are a combination of a verb + the -tion ending.  Here are some examples:
      subtract + -tion = subtraction
      vacate  + -tion = vacation
      explain + -tion = explanation   (Sometimes there is a spelling change.)

II.  The syllable before the -tion is almost always the stressed syllable.  Let's look at and listen to our example words:
     subtraction = sub-TRAK-shun
     vacation = vei-KEI-shun
     explanation = ex-pla-NEI-shun

In some of our pronunciation videos, you may have heard the word "schwa." 
The word "schwa" is very strange.  If you ask a native speaker what it means, they probably won't know, 
but it is the most common sound in American English.
Watch this video to learn more about the all-important schwa!
Schwa happens in unstressed syllables.
The syllable is reduced and said quickly.
Schwa is relaxed.  (Kind of like "uh.")  There is no tension.
Any vowel letter can be the schwa sound.

#### 11. Vocabulary #1: Using a Thesaurus
Many people believe that using a dictionary will help them increase their vocabulary--well, maybe. 
But there's a better tool to help remind you of the words you already know and to teach you new words.
That tool is a thesaurus.  A dictionary gives you a definition, but a thesaurus gives you a list of words that are similar. 
The similar words are called synonyms.
You can use a book called a thesaurus, but there's a perfectly good website called, simply, 
Thesaurus.com Links to an external site.
