#### 4. Formal vs. Informal Speech
https://youtu.be/zbKLghk2eFg
Have you ever thought about the difference between "Hello" and "Hi"?  "Hello" is slightly more formal in English.
If you go to a job interview or your first day of work, you would say "Hello" to the people there--not "Hi." 
With your close friends, you would say "Hi."  For classmates and people in public, it can get a bit tricky.  
California tends to be less formal than many other states, so saying "Hi" to your teacher or classmates is acceptable.
The first time you meet someone or send them an email, you should use "Hello" and then see how they answer back.  
Once the other person uses "Hi," it's usually okay to use "Hi" with them after that.
In addition to our word choice, there are other differences between formal and informal speech. 
There's nothing wrong with sounding formal, but sometimes it seems a bit unusual.  
Even when we are in formal situations, we don't pronounce all of the sounds in English.  
This is a great video that shows you how to sound more natural.

#### 5. Introduce Yourself
1) What name do you prefer to go by?  ("To go by" is an idiom that means to be called a certain name.)
2) What brought you to DVC?  
   1) ("What brought you" or "What brings you" is an idiom that means what are your reasons for doing something?)
3) What's something you like about US culture?
4) What's something you don't like about US culture?
5) What's something you like about your home culture?
6) Add anything else you want to tell the class.

#### 6. Pronouns and Possessive Adjectives

### Unit 3
#### 7. Phrasal verbs
Phrasal verbs are verbs that are made of more than one word.  
There is usually a root to a main verb and then an extra word or words that completely change the meaning of the root word.  
For example, the word hang means this:
But when "hang" is joined with other small words, the meaning changes. 
Here are some examples:
hang up
hang out

#### 8. The -tion Noun Ending
By now, you probably know that many nouns end in -tion in English.  Here are a few helpful hints about the -tion ending.
I.  Most -tion nouns in English are a combination of a verb + the -tion ending.  Here are some examples:
      subtract + -tion = subtraction
      vacate  + -tion = vacation
      explain + -tion = explanation   (Sometimes there is a spelling change.)

II.  The syllable before the -tion is almost always the stressed syllable.  Let's look at and listen to our example words:
     subtraction = sub-TRAK-shun
     vacation = vei-KEI-shun
     explanation = ex-pla-NEI-shun

### Unit 4
#### 10. Pronunciation Practice: schwa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syX-07rhxoE
In some of our pronunciation videos, you may have heard the word "schwa." 
The word "schwa" is very strange.  If you ask a native speaker what it means, they probably won't know, 
but it is the most common sound in American English.
Watch this video to learn more about the all-important schwa!
Schwa happens in unstressed syllables.
The syllable is reduced and said quickly.
Schwa is relaxed.  (Kind of like "uh.")  There is no tension.
Any vowel letter can be the schwa sound.

#### 11. Vocabulary #1: Using a Thesaurus
Many people believe that using a dictionary will help them increase their vocabulary--well, maybe. 
But there's a better tool to help remind you of the words you already know and to teach you new words.
That tool is a thesaurus.  A dictionary gives you a definition, but a thesaurus gives you a list of words that are similar. 
The similar words are called synonyms.
You can use a book called a thesaurus, but there's a perfectly good website called, simply, 
Thesaurus.com Links to an external site.
https://www.thesaurus.com/

#### 12. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 1, what a syllable is?
Many students worry about pronouncing individual sounds, but word stress is more important than pronouncing sounds exactly. 
But before we focus on word stress, we have to remember what a syllable is.

Watch this for a quick review of what a syllable is. 
https://youtu.be/sqHRA5_AreY
Stressed syllables receive emphasis and full pronunciation; they are often louder.
The number of vowel sounds within a word determines the number of syllables.

#### 13. Verb Endings (Suffixes)
Verbs can be tricky in English.  Sometimes they have suffixes; sometimes they don't.  
It helps to learn some common verb suffixes because you can identify and learn new verbs by recognizing these suffixes and how they are usually pronounced.
Here are some common verb endings and some examples with them. 
(The usual stress pattern is shown, but, of course, with English, there are many exceptions.)

#### 14. Speaking Introducing Yourself 
We often have to introduce ourselves, and no matter how many times we do it, for many people, it can make us nervous. 
One of the best practices for feeling more comfortable speaking is practice. 
If you have a formalized introduction of yourself that you have written and practiced, 
then when you are asked to introduce yourself, you will feel more confident.
This will come in handy when you are at a job interview.
This is a speaking assignment, but if it helps you to write it out first and then read it, that's fine. 
For this assignment, speak for two minutes introducing yourself.
Because this is practice for an interview, we'll begin with the word "Hello" rather than "Hi." 
Be sure to tell your me your name and where you're from.  This could be your home country or where you live now.
Consider the following questions, but also add anything you think is interesting or useful to know about you:
What is your work experience?
What is your education experience?
What special skills do you have?  (Don't forget that you are bilingual.  That is extremely valuable!)
What hobbies do you have?
What goals do you have?

### Unit 5
#### 15. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 2
https://youtu.be/XASBN5uMdEk
Stressed syllables receive emphasis and full pronunciation; they are often louder and last longer. 
(Helpful tip:  For words ending in -ion, the stress is almost always on the syllable right before the ion. 
For example, information =  in-fer-MEI-shuhn.)

#### 16. Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 1
Here's a good one.  Be sure to watch the whole thing!  (No, there won't be a quiz on this, but be sure not to skip over this--"r" is the hardest sound to make in English.)

(This sound can also be found on the American IPA Chart Links to an external site.as the "r" for "rabbit.")

#### 17. Word Forms: Adjectives
The phrases "word forms" and "suffixes" are closely related.  Word forms tell us the part of speech of a word. 
Suffixes are word endings that tell us the part of speech of a word.  Not all words in English have suffixes. 
Many nouns and verbs do not.  However, many adjectives and adverbs do.

Please watch this video on word forms.  It covers the suffixes for several parts of speech. 
(Ignore any references to a book.  It was made when I still used books for my classes.  Also, ignore the unit number.)  
In this unit, we will be focusing on adjectives.

https://youtu.be/R4vl1H0vdK4

### Unit 6
#### 18. Pronunciation Practice: "o" as in "Rose"
"O" is a sound that most of you have in your native language.  
Did you know that in English, the "o" sound is actually two vowel sounds together? 
We don't just say "o" in English--we say "o" with a rounded "u" sound at the end. 
Working on this sound will help you with clarity in many of your words.

https://youtu.be/w7O08xhdH0Q

### 19. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 3
https://youtu.be/dQ4rUdsh_hQ
https://www.merriam-webster.com/
https://www.dictionary.com/
Here are two good online dictionaries:  Meriam Webster  site.and Dictionary.com . 
Type in any word (like "apple") and notice how they show the syllable stress in different ways.

### 20. Word Forms: Adverbs
Word forms tell us the part of speech of a word. Suffixes are word endings that tell us the part of speech of a word.
Not all words in English have suffixes.
Many nouns and verbs do not. However, many adjectives and adverbs do.

One of the easiest suffixes to remember is the most common suffix for adverbs: -ly. 

Now that we know the form of adverbs and some exceptions, it helps to know what an adverb is! 
An adverb can have one of these three functions:
1). it modifies a verb
2). it modifies an adjective
3). it modifies another adverb.

I remember this by looking at the word "adverb" itself. 
First, there is the "ad" at the beginning of the word--that reminds me that adverbs can modify adjectives.
Then I look at the end of the word "verb"--that's an easy one; that reminds me that adverbs can modify verbs.
Then I look at the whole word--"adverb"--and that reminds me that adverbs can modify verbs.
Here some example sentences:

He is extremely tall.              (Here, "extremely" is an adverb modifying the adjective "tall.")
He walks slowly.                    (Here, "slowly" is an adverb modifying the verb "walks.")
He walks very slowly.           (Here, "very" is an adverb modifying the adverb "slowly.")

B.   Have you been to any other states in the US?  If so, what was your experience like there?  If you haven't been to any other states, what other states do you know about?  What is your impression of those states?

C.  Pronunciation Practice:  Rose "o"

https://youtu.be/eRoL9YJa0lQ
bird work concur reverse over teacher mother her later perhaps turn stir journey

#### 25. Pronunciation Practice: Intonation
There are a few terms in pronunciation that are often confused.  These are "stress," "tone," and "intonation." 
In simple terms, here are their definitions:
1). Stress refers to syllable stress in a word, meaning how long and how loud the syllable is said.
2). Tone refers to the pitch of a word or syllable, meaning how high or low the word or syllable is said.
3). Intonation refers to the pitch of words across a sentence, such as whether certain words or syllables rise or fall.
Here are two great videos that demonstrate intonation for questions and clarification.
https://youtu.be/Aoj4HZlLQBY
https://youtu.be/GFwxtdhNZJw
Did you go to the party? /What did you bring to the party? /Did you pick up the groceries? /Does the store open at one?
Can you lend me a dollar? /How are you? /Why did you leave? /Where are the keys? /Who are you calling? /Which one did you buy?
Can I borrow your book? /Where's your book? /Did you go to the show? /How was the show? /Did you see Amanda? /When did you see Amanda?
What? /Pardon? /I beg your pardon? /I'm sorry? /I'm sorry. /Come again. /I didn't understand.  Could you repeat that? /I didn't catch that.

#### 26. Word Order: SVOMPT
You've probably heard that the word order in English is the following:  Subject + Verb + Object.  We sometimes abbreviate that to SVO.  
There's even more to word order than that.  Have you heard of SVOMPT?  It stands for Subject + Verb + Object + Manner (how) + Place + Time.

### Unit 8
#### 29. Pronunciation Practice: silver "i"

It is often confused with green "e" and takes a while to master.  It is a very relaxed sound, so be sure to relax your mouth!
https://youtu.be/Oqgpxz4fXEI
"elbow grease"
After a bit of elbow grease, my kitchen shine and sparkle again.
#### 30. Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 3
https://youtu.be/WMkrolnBMPg

#### 31. Simple Present
Do you know the top five most common errors of non-native speakers?  You probably won't be surprised to know what they are:
1). articles
2). prepositions
3). subject-verb agreement with third person in simple present
4). verb form
5). word choice
We're going to focus now on the one that happens every day--#3--the missing "s" on the simple present verb with the third person.
The main uses of the simple present:
to express something that happens regularly:
      I always eat breakfast.         She eats a lot of candy.
to express a fact:
       Omnivores eat meat and plants.
       Vegetarians don't eat meat.
to speak about a movie, book, or story:
       Romeo loves Juliet.
       Shakespeare writes, "Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it."

The simple present IS NOT expressed when speaking about "right now."
Right now, I am taking an ESL class.   (Not:  Right now, I take an ESL class.)

#### 32: Voiced and Voiceless Sounds
https://youtu.be/XNrloK1KA0c
All sounds in English are either voiced or voiceless.  "Voiced" means that your throat vibrates when you make the sound; 
"voiceless" means that your throat doesn't vibrate when you make the sound. 
You can feel the vibration by touching your throat or the top of your head when you make the sound.

There are more sounds in the English language than there are in the alphabet, 
but here is a rough guide for which sounds are voiced and which are voiceless:
First, all vowels are voiced:  a, e, i, o, and u.

#### 33: Pronunciation Practice: "s" endings
When we use the "s" on the simple present tense third-person singular verbs (for "he," "she," "it," and other singular nouns), 
the "s" sound follows the same rule as it does for other words.
There are three ways to pronounce the final "s" sound, whether it's on verbs or other parts of speech:
1). "s"
2). "z"
3). "ihz"
For "s" before voiceless letters, the sound is a pure "s" sound.
For "s" before voiced letters, the sound is a pure "z" sound.
For "s" before other sounds that are like "s," the sound is an "ihz" sound.  (Like silver "i" with a "z.")

Here are some verbs for each category:
eats, lacks, helps, laughs
plays, loves, begs, smells
kisses, sneezes, catches, washes
https://youtu.be/hde9Sg75Nn4

#### 34. Pronunciation Practice: Contractions
You may hear that you should not use contractions in English. That is absolutely incorrect!  
We use contractions all the time in our speaking.  It used to be that you couldn't use them in your academic writing, but even that rule is changing.  
For now, avoid contractions in your writing, but do use them in speaking.  You will sound much more natural in your speaking if you do.
What are contractions?  They are the shortening of two words by combining them.  
When we combine them, we delete at least one letter and replace it with an apostrophe in writing.
Here is a clear explanation, and below it are some common examples. 
These examples include some that are accepted in writing and some that are not.  
They are all accepted in speaking.

#### 35. Optional Practice for Unit 8
A.   Do you feel that the three-branch system of the United States is fair? 
Why or why not?  What is the system of government in your home country like?  
Do you think it is fair?  Why or why not?
B.   Pronunciation Practice: silver "i"
C.  Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 3
D.  Pronunciation Practice: "s" endings
E.  Pronunciation Practice: Contractions

### Unit 9
#### 37. Pronunciation Practice: black "a"
Here is a sound that may not exist in your native language.  
(If your native language is Persian, you can probably make this sound easily because it is one of the few languages like English that has this sound.)
This sound is often called "short a," but it is better described as the "a" in "black cat" on The Color Vowel Chart Links to an external site..
black "a" (not "red" and not "olive")
1). Drop your jaw!
2). Pull back your lips (like you're smiling!)
https://youtu.be/QJd5c1T1t-w
"hand in"separable :The first thing I need to do after I wake up this morning is hand in my Phrasal Verbs # 3 homework, because I forgot to finished it last night.

#### 38. Pronunciation Practice: "th"
"th":  This is probably the third hardest sound to make!  
Here's Keenyn again in a great video on how to pronounce "th" in English 
(but I disagree with how she pronounces "with"--I think it should be voiced.)
https://youtu.be/BBSU6A-CRx0
