# ESL Learning 065 note summary
### Week 1
#### 1. Finding things in common
For our first week, I'd like everyone to get to know each other. Here's a fun activity for you to try.

Finding things in common:

We all play many roles in life. We are parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, etc. 

At school we are "students". However, we may not know very much about each other in our every day lives.

Tonight, you will get to know each other a little better through our class discussion.

What to do?

Please share the following information with your classmates and pictures if you can:

What is your favorite color?

What hobbies do you have?

What kind of books do you read?

What is your favorite book?

What is your favorite movie or tv show?

Do you have any pets? What kind of pets do you have?

What kind of music do you like?

Here's an example to help you:

My name is Izyy.

My favorite color is blue.

I have many hobbies including: reading, writing books, singing, going for walks, and making different crafts.

I love reading many types of books: mystery, action adventure, novels, fantasy, sci-fi, literature, etc.

My favorite book is Jane Eyre. It's a classic literature book that shows a very strong female main character who explores her role in life and whether she has a right to love. It's a great read.

I love many movies and tv shows. My favorite movie of all time is The Princess Bride. It's a great romantic comedy from the 1980's. I love funny movies. They help me relax and forget about other things in life.

I have one cat. He's very mischievous, but loves to cuddle as well.

I have a very eclectic taste in music from: jazz, classical, pop, rock, alternative, techno, trance, new age, opera, etc.

Example Reply:

Hi Izyy,

my name is Bob. I also love to read many books. In fact, I've been recently reading The Hobbit by J.R.R. 

Tolkien. Have you read it before? I love reading about Bilbo's journey through Middle Earth. 

You are probably familiar with The Lord of the Rings. This book happens before The Lord of the Rings.

I have a cat too! In fact, I have 3 cats. Their names are Jingles, Tommy, and Snowball.

They usually get along with each other, but they sometimes fight, especially over their favorite toys. 

Aren't cats great?

I love 80's movies too, but I've never seen The Princess Bride.

Maybe some day I will watch it. My favorite 80's movie is The Goonies. 

Those kids go on such fun adventures. And to think, that was one of Josh Brolin's first roles as an actor.

Now, he's played Thanos in the Marvel movies. That's crazy!

Hello everyone,

I am Lina. I have 3 goals for ESL 65.
1. I want to communicate with others fluently.
2.  I want to improve my intonation.
3. I wish I can understand American idioms and use them in right way.

#### 2. Introduction to IPA Vowels
What is IPA?

Most people imagine the IPA to be a kind of beer, but the IPA in question is the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

Different languages use different spelling for different sounds. However, the IPA represents EVERY sound in EVERY language using SPECIFIC symbols that DON'T change. 

This means that every time you see a specific IPA symbol it will ALWAYS represent the SAME sound no matter what language it's being used in.


Why should you learn IPA?

Listening and proper pronunciation of words is very important in improving your language skills. 

When you learn what IPA symbols mean, you can more easily identify that sound and that symbol together. 

It helps train your hearing for specific sounds, and reading IPA spelling for words, helps you identify more words that use those sounds which helps you improve your pronunciation.


Why should you study IPA vowels first?

Usually vowel sounds in English are the hardest to learn because English only uses 5 letters to represent 14 vowel sounds that exist in English. 

This leads to many problems for English learners. 

It's important to begin with vowel sounds for listening to get the ears used to different sounds occurring in different common words, 

and to practice improving pronunciation of these common words for easier learning.

Here's a list of the 14 English Vowel Sounds:
IPA


Vowel sounds: (11 normal 3 diphthongs) There are 14 vowel sounds total in English

/i/= ee  /I/=yh  /uw/= oo  /ʊ/= ugh  /ey/=A  /ɛ/= eh  /ə/= uh  /ow/= oh  /æ/= aah  /a/= ah  /ɔ/= aw

Diphthongs: (Dipthongs are when you combine 2 vowel sounds to create a new unique sound)

/ay/= ai (eye)

/oy/= oi (toy)

/aw/= ou (how)

Two kind of vowels:

1). 'stressed vowel/tense vowel, it's because you have to stretch the muscles in your face to make it. 

2). relaxed vowel: your body and you mouth doesn't have to do anything special to say them.

Here's a chart with examples of each vowel sound:


1). /i/ I have to smile when I say this sound, stressed vowel

/i/:Cheese Please Tease Sheep Team, East, Green, Heat, Leap, Keep, Sleep

2). /I/ relaxed version, yh, it comes from the back of your throat.

the sound is relaxed. 

/ə/: Fun  Sun/son Love Money Tough, Drum, Truck,Run, Lung, Hug, 

8)./ow/: a little bit more stressed. it's not as tense as "OO" because you have to tense up for that one.

but it is "OH" so you still have to keep your mouth open in an "O" shape

/ow/: Boat Coat Owe Low No, Slow, Float, Load, Know,No, Flow, Go, Home, Loan, 

9)./æ/: tense vowel here, you really have to open up and go

#### 3. Introduction to Pragmatics
What are Pragmatics?

Pragmatics are types of words, phrases, or sentences that speakers of a language use to be polite.

These types of communication have a very specific form of grammar that does NOT change very much 

because it is used to communicate specific ideas in specific situations.

For example, how to introduce yourself. Most languages have a very specific way to introduce oneself.

In English for example we say,
Hello/hi.
How are you?
It's nice to meet you.
Why should you learn Pragmatics?

In order for you to communicate very clearly in any language, you need to know and understand the common pragmatics for polite communication. 

When you learn how to use American English pragmatics, 

you can communicate very clearly and easily in most social situations between different people in a very polite way.

#### 33. Wednesday Class Activity #1: Class Discussion #5: Hobbies
Discussion Topic #5: Hobbies (Think about and try to answer the following questions. Discuss with a partner)
How many hobbies do you have?
What are your hobbies?
How often do you do your hobbies? Why?
What is your favorite hobby? Why?
Do you want to share your hobbies with other people? Why or why not?

Izyy's Example Hobby:
One of my hobbies is making fleece scarves. I like this hobby because it is fun, easy, and useful.
I go to a craft store like Joann's or Michael's and buy at least 1-2 yards of fleece fabric in different designs. Then, I take measurements for the person I want to make a scarf for. Next, I find the pattern they want. I measure and cut the fleece to the right size. I then measure both ends of the fabric from 1-2 inches from the edge. I use a tape measure to mark where to cut a fringe. I cut the fringe. And make sure everything is even. If I need to, I trim any excess fabric. Fleece is great because it doesn't unravel like other fabrics. I don't have to seal the edges. The scarf is done and ready to be given as a gift for winter.
I only do this hobby in winter when the weather is cold enough for fleece scarves.
I don't think I'd ever do this hobby as a job since it's seasonal and you can only have so many scarves really.

Idioms for History
Here are some very common American English Idioms for "History".

History Idioms

1). Achilles’ Heel (adj. phrase): A person's weak spot is their Achilles' heel.
Example: I’m a horrible cook. That’s my Achilles heel.

2). Actions speak louder than words (expression): This idiom means that what people actually do is more important than what they say. People can promise things but then fail to deliver.
Example: You can promise to clean your room, or you can actually clean your room. I think actions speak louder than words.

3). Ahead of time (prepositional phrase): If something happens ahead of time, it happens early or before the set time.
Example: I’m so happy I finished my homework very early. I’m finished ahead of time.

4). All roads lead to Rome (expression): This means that there can be many different ways of doing something.
Example: There are many ways to read. In the end, what matters most is that you understand what you read. All roads lead to Rome.

5). As you sow, so shall you reap (expression): This means that if you do bad things to people, bad things will happen to you or good things if you do good things.
Example: (1) I’m so happy you helped that man find a job. As you sow, so shall you reap. I think good things will happen for you.

Example: (2) You should not have stolen money from your mother. As you sow, so shall you reap. You be careful. Bad things may happen to you.

6). Bad Blood (adj. phrase): If people feel hate because of things that happened in the past, there is bad blood between them.
Example: There is bad blood between me and my friend Carla. She stole my boyfriend a few years ago. Now, I hate her.

7). A clean slate (adj. phrase): If you start something with a clean slate, then nothing bad from your past is taken into account.
Example: I used to be a bad student. Now in college, I hope to start with a clean slate. I’m going to try to be the best student I can be.

8). A day in the sun (expression): If you have your day in the sun, you get attention and are appreciated.
Example: When I work, I don’t feel very appreciated. I hope one day, I’ll have my day in the sun too.

9). Dwell on the past (phrasal verb): Thinking too much about the past, so that it becomes a problem is to dwell on the past. Usually we tell people not to dwell on the past. It will not help you solve your present problems.
Example: I keep telling my sister that she shouldn’t dwell on the past. She is no longer a teenager who made many mistakes. She is now an adult and should think about her adult life.

10). Eleventh hour (adj. phrase): If something happens at the eleventh hour, it happens right at the last minute. This idiom is used especially when you must finish something by a specific time, and you are afraid you may not have enough time to finish on time.
Example: My boss wanted me to finish my report by 11pm tonight. I was afraid I wouldn’t finish in time, but I finally finished it at the eleventh hour.

Izyy's Example Conversation:

Izyy: I've always wanted to paint and draw, but I have no talent. These are my Achille's heel. 

Monica: Ah, I've always been a very good artist. Art is easy for me. It's duck soup! However, I can't sing at all. I have a terrible voice! That's my Achille's heel!

Izyy: Ah, singing for me is very easy. I have been singing since I was 5 years old. You know you can always train your singing voice.

Monica: I think I'm too old to start training singing now. I would be training at the eleventh hour.

Izyy: Yes, but you can do it. Besides, it shouldn't matter how old you are when you start practicing. In the end, all roads lead to Rome. You can still become a very good singer.

Monica: Yes, you are right. However, you too can become a better artist with a lot of practice. And as they say, "as you sow, so shall you reap." If you practice really hard, you can become better at art.

Izyy: I guess you are right. Perhaps I should forget about the past and start with a clean slate?

Monica: Yes, I think you should. Maybe one day you will have your day in the sun and show off your art.

4). A tight rein (noun phrase): If things or people are kept on a tight rein, they are given very little freedom or controlled carefully. This idiom comes from horseback riding. Most often it is used in horse racing to keep the horse from going too fast at the beginning, save the horses energy, before letting the horse run more quickly later. The reins are what control the horse’s head.

Example: I recently met my high school teacher at a café. The poor woman has seen better days. I think she has some health problems.

8). Having a senior moment (phrasal verb): A memory lapse or a momentary confusion in someone who is no longer young is a senior moment. Recently, this idiom is used more generally about whenever you forget something and can’t remember it. It can happen to anyone, but usually is something that people think happens more often in older people, seniors.

Example: Sure I’d love to buy a new car, but something as expensive as a Ferrari is out of my league.

15). To hit the bullseye (phrasal verb): If someone hits the bull's-eye, they are exactly right about something or achieve the best result possible. "Bulls-eye" and "bullseye" are alternative spellings. This idiom comes from archery where the bullseye is the middle of the target.

16). An armchair quarterback (noun phrase): An armchair quarterback is someone who offers advice, especially about football, but never shows that they could actually do any better.
Example: For all the times my brother says he can cook better than me, he’s just an armchair quarterback. I have never seen him actually cooking in the kitchen.

Example Conversation:
Izyy: My friend is an armchair quarterback when it comes to bowling. He is always criticizing me about how I bowl, but he's not very good at bowling himself.

Fassil: Oh, really? Maybe he is just trying to keep a tight rein on you, so you don't win.

Izyy: Maybe. To be honest, I haven't had enough sleep lately. He'll probably beat me. I need to take a cat nap. 

Fassil: Yes, I didn't want to say anything, but you look like you have seen better days.

Izyy: I look that bad? Oh, boy. Maybe I should get spa treatment to turn back the clock.

#### 43. Monday: Class Activity #1: 3 Final IPA Vowel Practice
#### 44. Wednesday: Class Activity #1: Important Historical Invention Discussion: Part 1 
Introduction:
What is an "invention"? It's something new that has been created to help society move forward.

Here's a list of Some Important Historical Inventions:

1. FIRE – it can be argued that fire was discovered rather than invented. Certainly, early humans observed incidents of fire, but it wasn’t until they figured out how to control it and produce it themselves that humans could really make use of everything this new tool had to offer. The earliest use of fire goes back as far as two million years ago, while a widespread way to utilize this technology has been dated to about 125,000 years ago. Fire gave us warmth, protection, and led to a host of other key inventions and skills like cooking. The ability to cook helped us get the nutrients to support our expanding brains Links to an external site., giving us an indisputable advantage over other primates.

2. WHEEL – the wheel was invented by Mesopotamians around 3500 B.C., to be used in the creation of pottery. About 300 years after that, the wheel was put on a chariot and the rest is history. Wheels are ubiquitous in our everyday life, facilitating our transportation and commerce.

3. NAIL – The earliest known use of this very simple but super-useful metal fastener dates back to Ancient Egypt, about 3400 B.C. If you are more partial to screws, they’ve been around since Ancient Greeks (1st or 2nd century B.C.).

4. OPTICAL LENSES – from glasses to microscopes and telescopes, optical lenses have greatly expanded the possibilities of our vision. They have a long history, first developed by ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians, with key theories of light and vision contributed by Ancient Greeks. Optical lenses were also instrumental components in the creation of media technologies involved in photography, film and television.

5. COMPASS – this navigational device has been a major force in human exploration. The earliest compasses were made of lodestone in China between 300 and 200 B.C.

6. PAPER – invented about 100 BC in China, paper has been indispensible in allowing us to write down and share our ideas.

7. GUNPOWDER – this chemical explosive, invented in China in the 9th century, has been a major factor in military technology (and, by extension, in wars that changed the course of human history).

8. PRINTING PRESS – invented in 1439 by the German Johannes Gutenberg, this device in many ways laid the foundation for our modern age. It allowed ink to be transferred from the movable type to paper in a mechanized way. This revolutionized the spread of knowledge and religion as previously books were generally hand-written (often by monks).

9. ELECTRICITY – utilization of electricity is a process to which a number of bright minds have contributed over thousands of years, going all the way back to Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece, when Thales of Miletus conducted the earliest research into the phenomenon. The 18th-century American Renaissance man Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with significantly furthering our understanding of electricity, if not its discovery. It’s hard to overestimate how important electricity has become to humanity as it runs the majority of our gadgetry and shapes our way of life. The invention of the light bulb, although a separate contribution, attributed to Thomas Edison in 1879, is certainly a major extension of the ability to harness electricity. It has profoundly changed the way we live, work as well as the look and functioning of our cities.

10. STEAM ENGINE – invented between 1763 and 1775 by Scottish inventor James Watt (who built upon the ideas of previous steam engine attempts like the 1712 Newcomen engine), the steam engine powered trains, ships, factories and the Industrial Revolution as a whole.

11. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE – the 19th-century invention (created by Belgian engineer Etienne Lenoir in 1859 and improved by Germany’s Nikolaus Otto in 1876), this engine that converts chemical energy into mechanical energy overtook the steam engine and is used in modern cars and planes. Elon Musk’s electric car company Tesla, among others, is currently trying to revolutionize technology in this arena once again.

12. TELEPHONE – although he was not the only one working on this kind of tech, Scottish-born inventor Alexander Graham Bell got the first patent for an electric telephone in 1876. Certainly, this instrument has revolutionized our ability to communicate.

13. VACCINATION – while sometimes controversial, the practice of vaccination is responsible for eradicating diseases and extending the human lifespan. The first vaccine (for smallpox) was developed by Edward Jenner in 1796. A rabies vaccine was developed by the French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur in 1885, who is credited with making vaccination the major part of medicine that is it today. Pasteur is also responsible for inventing the food safety process of pasteurization, that bears his name.

14. CARS – cars completely changed the way we travel, as well as the design of our cities, and thrust the concept of the assembly line into the mainstream. They were invented in their modern form in the late 19th century by a number of individuals, with special credit going to the German Karl Benz for creating what’s considered the first practical motorcar in 1885.

15. AIRPLANE – invented in 1903 by the American Wright brothers, planes brought the world closer together, allowing us to travel quickly over great distances. This technology has broadened minds through enormous cultural exchanges—but it also escalated the reach of the world wars that would soon break out, and the severity of every war thereafter.

16. PENICILLIN – discovered by the Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming in 1928, this drug transformed medicine by its ability to cure infectious bacterial diseases. It began the era of antibiotics.

17. ROCKETS – while the invention of early rockets is credited to the Ancient Chinese, the modern rocket is a 20th century contribution to humanity, responsible for transforming military capabilities and allowing human space exploration.

18. NUCLEAR FISSION – this process of splitting atoms to release a tremendous amount of energy led to the creation of nuclear reactors and atomic bombs. It was the culmination of work by a number of prominent (mostly Nobel Prize-winning) 20th-century scientists, but the specific discovery of nuclear fission is generally credited to the Germans Otto Hahn and Fritz Stassmann, working with the Austrians Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.

19. SEMICONDUCTORS – they are at the foundation of electronic devices and the modern Digital Age. Mostly made of silicon, semiconductor devices are behind the nickname of “Silicon Valley”, home to today’s major U.S. computing companies. The first device containing semiconductor material was demonstrated in 1947 by America’s John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley of Bell Labs.

20. PERSONAL COMPUTER – invented in the 1970s, personal computers greatly expanded human capabilities. While your smartphone is more powerful, one of the earliest PCs was introduced in 1974 by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) via a mail-order computer kit called the Altair. From there, companies like Apple, Microsoft, and IBM have redefined personal computing.

21. THE INTERNET – while the worldwide network of computers (which you used to find this article) has been in development since the 1960s, when it took the shape of U.S. Defense Department’s ARPANET, the Internet as we know it today is an even more modern invention. 1990s creation of the World Wide Web by England’s Tim Berners-Lee is responsible for transforming our communication, commerce, entertainment, politics, you name it.

What are some important events that you remember about history? Why?
What kind of history do you pay attention to? Why?
What do you think is the most important historical event that changed the world? Why?

Oct 5 at 2:38pm
Example Responses: (Izyy)

1. Covid-19 = it's the biggest event in recent history. It really changed the world a lot. I think we will never look at the world the same way after Covid. Another important thing I remember happening in history was when we first got the internet in 1995. It created a lot of changes at school, work, and everywhere. I remember going on the internet as a kid for the first time. I thought I had discovered a new world. I wanted to learn everything I could about it. 

2. I usually pay attention to developing technology in history. I find it fascinating to see how technology develops over time and changes the world. This is one reason why I enjoy reading about robots, medicine, and possible changes for the future based on our past.

3. I think the most important thing that changed our world is technology. Over the last 100+ years, our society has really advanced a lot because of technology. That most important technology being the computer. Without computers in history, we wouldn't have gone to the Moon, or have GPS, or have personal computers, the internet, smart phones, or social networks. Building the first computers changed the world forever.

### Week 8 
#### 47. Introduction and Practice of Question Pragmatics

https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/crevhqVVCTa
How to form Yes/No Questions:

Helping/Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb + Object?
Example:

Do       you      like       apples?

H.V    subj.     M.V.      obj.

·         Is/Are – Present Tense

·         Was/were –Past Tense

·         Will – Future Tense
·         Can   - Present tense         

·         Could- Past tense

·         Do/does – Present tense

·         Did – Past Tense
Common Forms of Yes/No helping verbs/auxiliary verbs:

How to form Wh- Questions: (why, where, which, how, who, when, what)

Wh-question word + Helping/auxiliary verb + subject + main verb + object?

Example:

Where               did      Donna    go          yesterday?

Wh-question      h.v.      subj.        m.v.         obj.

 

Wh- Question words and what information is needed:

·         Who = Person

·         What = Thing

·         Where = Place

·         When = Time

·         Why = Reason/explanation

·         Which = Choice

·         How = method/way to do something

 Important Note: # of verbs in a sentence:

Verb tenses can be different in number of verbs used in a sentence. If you have only 1 verb, you should switch that verb with the subject to create a question.

Example: (Sentence)

Sandra    is    young.

Subj.    verb.   Obj.

Example: (question)

Is        Sandra   young?

Verb    subj.         obj.

If your sentence uses a verb tense that has 2 or more verbs, ONLY switch the helping verb before the subject. Keep the main verb in its original position.

Example: (sentence)

Sandra    is   coming     to    the      party.

Subj.       h.v.      m.v.        OBJECT

Example: (question)

Is       Sandra    coming    to    the   party?

### Week 9
#### 50. Introduction and Practice of 5 IPA Consonants
Consonant Sounds:
Consonants are different from vowels. Vowels are sounds that you make when your mouth is OPEN. 
Consonants are sounds that you make when you somehow BLOCK air coming from your mouth.

Why 25 Consonant Sounds?
English contains 25 consonant SOUNDS. Remember, letters do NOT always = sounds. 
There are only 26 LETTERS in the English alphabet, but there are 39 SOUNDS in the English language. 
Please remember that every consonant sound on the IPA does NOT exist in English. 
Some of the sounds exist in OTHER languages. We will ONLY focus on 25 consonant sounds in English.

#### 51. Introduction and Practice of Lifestyle Idioms
Idioms for Lifestyle
Here are some very common American English Idioms for "Lifestyle".

Lifestyle Idioms

1). Hand to mouth (existence)(noun phrase): Someone who's living from hand to mouth, is very poor and needs the little money they have coming in to cover their expenses.
Example: When my husband lost his job, we began to live hand to mouth. Every paycheck I bring home only covers our expenses from month to month.

2). The Haves (noun phrase): A have is a person who is wealth/rich.
Example: I used to have a childhood friend who was part of the haves. Her parents were both doctors and always had fancy parties.

3). The have nots (noun phrase): A have not is a person without wealth or power.
Example: I remember as a child, many people referred to my family as the have nots. We were very poor and could barely afford to pay for all our expenses.

4). Here today, gone tomorrow (expression): Money, happiness and other desirable things are often here today, gone tomorrow, which means that they don't last for very long. This phrase is often used to remind people that we should appreciate what we have in life because you never know when those things will be gone.
Example: Sarah: I hate my big sister. She’s always bossing me around! Jane: Hey, you should be happy. I don’t even have a sister. And just wait. Your sister will be going to college soon. You’ll miss her then. Here today, gone tomorrow you know.

5). Different strokes for different folks (adj. phrase): This idiom means that different people do things in different ways that suit them.
Example: I like to jog in the park in the evening. My brother likes to jog in the park in the morning. I guess there are different strokes for different folks.

6). Live and let live (phrasal verb): If you live and let live, you accept other people as they are, although they may have a different way of life.
Example: I don’t understand how my neighbor can go and hunt live animals. I love animals and could never go hunt them. I guess I should just live and let live.

7). Make ends meet (phrasal verb): To make enough money to pay for your expenses.
Example: I used to have a difficult time making ends meet, but now with a better job, I can easily pay for all my bills and still have extra money for things I want to buy.

8). To march to the beat of your own drum (phrasal verb): If people march to the beat of their own drum, they do things the way they want without taking other people into consideration.
Example: I know some people tell me I should think about how my actions have consequences for my family, but I don’t really care. I march to the beat of my own drum.

9). To meet someone halfway (phrasal verb): If you meet someone halfway, you accept some of their ideas and make concessions.
Example: I agree with you about getting rid of school loans, but I don’t agree with you about how to get rid of school loans. How about if I meet you halfway? I’ll accept the idea at least that school loans should be eliminated.

Example Conversation:

Izyy: I'm worried about my friend David. He always marches to the beat of his own drum, but this has created big problems for him. Last month, he gambled and lost $5,000 at the casino. He had to live a hand to mouth existence this month. He barely had enough money to buy food to eat.

Julia: Aren't his parents rich? I thought they were the haves.

Izyy: They are, but they think that David needs to be a responsible adult and make his own money. For now, that means he's a have not.

Julia: Isn't he studying to become a computer network engineer? That pays a lot of money.

Izyy: Yes, he is, but he is not a computer engineer yet. He still has to take 3 more years of school before he finishes and with the way he gambles away his money, It can be here today, and gone tomorrow.

Julia: Yes, but I don't think you can help him by giving him money all the time. He will never learn his lesson.

Izyy: I agree. That is why I asked him to meet me halfway. If he finishes all his classes this semester with A's, I promised I would give him some money to help him.

Julia: That sounds fair. I don't have any money, so I can't help him. He just needs to let me live and let live and stop asking me for money.

Izyy: I hope he is successful. Different strokes for different folks you know. I think he will be successful in the end.

Example Conversations: Izyy: (ALL 9 Idioms)

Izyy: Last month was very difficult. My brother lost his job, so he can barely make ends meet.

Lisa: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Last year, I had a very difficult work situation too, so I understand your brother's situation. I was part of the have nots last year. This year, I am making much better money, so I am part of the haves. 

Izyy: Yes, you are very lucky. I know my brother doesn't have much experience with hotel services, but I think he can learn very quickly and get a new job as hotel concierge. However, he says he doesn't want that job. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

Lisa: You know, maybe you can get him some training first to help him get used to the idea of the hotel job. You can meet him halfway.

Izyy: Maybe you are right. I might try that. In the end however, the final decision is his, but if he doesn't take that hotel job soon, it may be here today, gone tomorrow.

Lisa: I guess you should just let him live and let live. It is his life after all.

Izyy: Yes, my brother is very stubborn. He marches to the beat of his own drum.

Lisa: As long as he doesn't have to live a hand to mouth existence, then it is ok.


#### 52. Monday: Class Activity #1: General IPA Vowel Practice: ALL 14 Vowels
#### 53. Monday: Class Activity #2: Class Discussion #8: Family
Discussion Topic #8: Family (Think about and try to answer the following questions. Discuss with a partner)
How often do you spend time with your family?
Do you have family that is far away? How often do you speak with them?
What are some of your favorite things to do with your family? Why?

Example Responses: (Izyy)

I'm usually pretty busy, so I don't have a lot of time to spend with my family. Besides, most of us are adults with busy jobs and lives that have different schedules. Sometimes, we meet for dinner together, but this is very uncommon. Usually, we have short conversations over the phone or watching movies together.
I have family around the world. I don't usually contact them very often. Once in a while we email each other or speak over skype. We try to keep up with big news at least, but we don't have time to keep up more often with smaller details like everyday life.
Usually, when I'm spending time with my family, we spend time talking over a meal like dinner. We also tend to watch movies together or go for walks outside. Most often we all meet for important events like birthdays, anniversaries, and other holidays like Thanksgiving or Easter. During the holidays, it's a great time to chat about life and anything new that is happening.
If there are kids present, we usually spend some time with the kids, playing with them. 

#### 54.Introduction and Practice of Compare/Contrast Pragmatics
Sharing Opinions:

I think...

I believe...

I often think...

I have often told people...

As I have told everyone in the past, I think...

I really think this is true.

Agree:
I completely agree with you.

Yes, I agree.

That is true.

Yes, that makes sense.

Yes, that is correct.

Yes, that’s right.

Disagree:
Well, I see what you mean, but I disagree.

I’m sorry, but I don’t agree with you.

I don’t think that’s true.

I can’t agree with you. Sorry, that isn’t true.

Share at least 10 opinions you have about different topics with your classmates.

Classmates can agree, or politely disagree about each topic.

Possible topics:
Pets
Home
Work
School
Vacation
Culture
History
Family
Example:
(Izyy): I think everyone should have a pet at least once in their lives. They can really enrich your life. Animals can also teach you many important life lessons.

(PETS) Izyy: I think everyone should have a pet at least 1 time in their life. They are great at teaching us responsibility, love, and are good for our health.

Julia: I understand why you say that, but I don't agree with you. I am very allergic to pets, so I can't have a pet. Also, I am too busy to even have a goldfish as a pet. I just don't have the time to take care of them! It wouldn't be fair to the pet, if I neglect them due to my busy schedule. The pets need someone who has enough time to care for them properly.

Izyy: I understand. I agree with you. I suppose I also think that people who are not good with pets, shouldn't have them either. The pet may have a bad life with someone who abuses, neglects, or doesn't know how to care for them. I think you have changed my mind about WHO should have pets. I also agree that having a pet when you are allergic, is probably not a good idea.

(VACATION) Izyy: I think my favorite place to go on vacation was Ireland. I have always wanted to go there since I was a little girl. I finally went for a visit with my boyfriend a few years ago. We really had a great time. It's so beautiful there. We loved the natural beauty, the people, and all the interesting things to see.

Julia: Ah, I see. I have never been to Ireland, but one reason I haven't gone is because I hear it rains a lot there. I don't enjoy rainy places very much like you do, so I have to disagree with you. Instead, I like to go to the beach a lot. My favorite beach in the world was in the Philippines. It's tropical weather, beautiful sandy beaches, and very kind people that make it the best place for a vacation.

Izyy: Isn't it rather humid there?

Julia: Yes, it can be very humid. It's a tropical environment, but I love it.

Izyy: Oh, I don't do very well with high humidity. I don't like that too much. It's bad for my asthma. I must disagree with you, although I'm sure it must be beautiful.

#### 56. Introduction and Practice of Environment Idioms
Idioms for Environment
Here are some very common American English Idioms for "Environment".

Environment Idioms

1. A disaster waiting to happen (noun phrase): If something is an accident/disaster waiting to happen, there's definitely going to be an accident or it's bound to go wrong. This idiom is used to encourage people to do something about a bad situation, so it doesn’t lead to a disaster.
Example: I knew that the hanging power lines were a disaster waiting to happen, so I called PG&E to fix them.

2. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure (expression): This expression means that it is better to try to avoid problems in the first place, rather than trying to fix them once they arise.
Example: When my mother started having a hard time breathing, I told her to go to the doctor. She told me it was nothing, but I told her, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

3. To be barking up the wrong tree (phrasal verb): If you are barking up the wrong tree, it means that you have completely misunderstood something or are totally wrong. This was a term taking from hunting when the dogs found the wrong animal.
Example: Rosa: You said you didn’t like “her” anymore. I didn’t know you hated me that much. Tina: When did I say that? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Daniel. I think you’re barking up the wrong tree, Rosa. I was talking about my boss, Kelly, not you.

4. Busy as a bee/busy as a beaver (adjective phrase): If you're as busy as a beaver or bee, you're very busy indeed.
Example: I work very long days, often more than one job. I’m always busy as a beaver/bee.

5. Can’t see the forest for its trees (phrasal verb:) If someone can't see the forest for its trees, they are too focused on specific details to see the whole bigger situation.
Example: When my brother lost his job, all he could think about was what his next job was going to be, but he forgot to look for more work in the meantime. He couldn’t see the forest for its trees.

6. A cloud of suspicion (noun phrase): If a cloud of suspicion hangs over an individual, it means that they are not believed or are distrusted.
Example: After the very strange things that happened at the last local elections, many people thought that the politician had a cloud of suspicion over him.

7. A cloud on the horizon (noun phrase): If you can see a problem ahead, you can call it a cloud on the horizon.
Example: When my boss called me about the latest business report, I could tell there was a cloud on the horizon.

8. To come with the territory (phrasal verb): If something comes with the territory, it is part of a job or responsibility and just has to be accepted, even if unpleasant.
Example: You knew that when you joined a dairy farm, you would have to clean up a lot of cow manure. It comes with the territory.

9. The cream of the crop (noun phrase): The cream of the crop is the best quality of something there is.
Example: I like very high quality ingredients when I cook dinner. I only buy the cream of the crop. Nothing else will do.

10. A deer in the headlights (noun phrase): When one is caught off-guard and needs to make a decision, but cannot react quickly. This idiom comes from the reaction deer often have when it’s dark and a car shines it’s headlights on it. The deer will stop in the middle of the road and not move when it should be running away.
Example: When my boss asked me to make a very quick decision about the company finances, I felt like a deer in the headlights. I wasn’t sure how to decide on the situation.

Example Conversation:

Izyy: Hi Mario!

Mario: Hi Izyy! I'm sorry, I can't talk. I have to run. I am busy as a bee this week!

Izyy: Oh no! Mario, I think you should slow down. You can't keep going this fast. It's a disaster waiting to happen!

Mario: I'm afraid I can't slow down. When I took the job at Google, I knew I would be very very busy. It comes with the territory.

Izyy: Yes, but I think you can't see the forest for the trees right now. Remember why you joined Google in the first place?

Mario: Yes, I wanted to become a great computer programmer to help my community.

Izyy: And how much time have you had to help your community?

Mario: Well, I admit I don't have much time to help. 

Izyy: See? I can see a cloud on the horizon. If you don't stop overworking yourself like this, you will end up very unhappy. Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!

Mario: I think you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm really doing ok. I can handle this pressure just fine.

Izyy: I'm worried that if you keep doing too much work, you will be like a deer in the headlights when you should make a big decision in your life. I also think your boss has a cloud of suspicion hanging over his head. These long work hours seem to be illegal. He can't make you work 15 hours every day. That's too much!

Mario: I'm the cream of the crop computer programmer! They cannot run the business without me! They need me!

Izyy: I hope you're right. Just make sure to take care of yourself, so you stay happy and healthy. Don't work too much.
Example Conversation:

1 = 

Izyy: Hi, Daniella. I'm sorry I can't talk. I'm busy as a bee! I have to get to class.

Daniella: You look like a deer in the headlights! Are you ok? There seems to be a cloud of suspicion hanging over you/ 

Izyy: I'm fine. I'm just very busy. Sorry, see you later! Bye!

2 = 

Izyy: I keep telling my boss that we need to update our software on our computers for safety. It's so old. It is easy for someone to steal our important information. It's a disaster waiting to happen!

John: Oh, really? That doesn't sound very safe. I guess working for a computer company though, having information stolen just comes with the territory.

Izyy: Yes, but we have computer programmers that are the cream of the crop who could fix this problem very quickly, but my boss just doesn't listen.

3 =

Izyy: I see a cloud on the horizon in my math class.

Harry: Oh really? Why?

Izyy: The math teacher told us we have a quiz next week, but she never gave us a study guide. I suspect many students will get bad grades on the test.

Harry: Yeah, if the teach just gave a study guide, well, that would help a lot. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure you know.

Izyy: My teacher thinks that if we just do the homework in class, we will be ok. I think she's barking up the wrong tree.

Daniella: Bye.

https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/crerfRVVhvo
Example Responses: (Culture + Family)

Izyy: I think it's very important to preserve culture, language, and traditions from home countries. It's also important to adapt to a new country's culture, language, and traditions; however, I don't think people should fully assimilate and forget where they come from. I know some people believe this is the best way to start a new life in a different country, but to me, it often means that people forget very important things about where they came from. Children of people who have decided to "Assimilate" versus "adapt" often find themselves searching for answers about WHO AM I? They feel very separated from other people because their families don't often speak about where they came from and why they are different. I understand the importance these parents place on teaching children to fit into the new country with less difficulties, but it seems like a shame to forget about the "other" side of who they are. I found it fascinating to learn about my family's culture back in Europe. It also gave me a new way to look at the world around me that many other people do not have the opportunity to do. 

I know many of my students worry that they will not be "accepted" if they do not "assimilate" into the new culture 100%. I think that's not true. You can "adapt" without having to "assimilate" 100%. You can still honor your roots.

Izyy: Family is very important to me. Ever since I was a kid, I grew up only knowing my nuclear family. My relatives were all very far away. I was always very sad at school as one of the only children who didn't have a grandma or uncle who could come into class for an important project. I couldn't share them with my classes because I didn't have a close relationship with them. Unlike other kids, I didn't have stories about them. I did have my brothers and parents though, making us very close knit.

#### 58. Monday: Class Activity #2: Class Discussion #9: Travel
Discussion Topic #9: Travel (Think about and try to answer the following questions. Discuss with a partner)
How often do you travel?
Where do you like to travel? Why?
What is the best place you have ever traveled to? Why?

Example Responses:

Not very often especially since the pandemic started, I work from home now, and I haven't really had much time off to travel anywhere. I hope to travel more in the future.
I like to travel to local places like Muir Woods or Point Reyes for natural beauty. I love nature, and these places are great to sit in nature and enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells. Being outside makes me happy. For longer trips, I enjoy visiting places in Europe where I have family. I have not seen my relatives for 11 years now, so I miss them. I would like to go back and visit them soon, I hope.
I think my favorite places I have ever traveled to is very difficult to choose. I have seen many amazing places, but one of my favorites was Ireland. The nature there is so lush and green. California doesn't receive as much rain, so nature is a bit different. Ireland is known as the "emerald isle" because it is so bright green. I loved it there.

Kevin: Hi, Izyy! It's good to hear from you. Yes, I'm leaving next week. I need you to care for my dog Sparky for 5 days starting on November 5th. Can you do it?

Izyy: November 5th? I think I can do it. Do I need to be there in the morning, afternoon, or evening?

Kevin: It is best if you come in the afternoon. You don't need to sleep over at my house. Just come 3 times a day to make sure Sparky is fed, taken for 2 walks, played with, and generally taken care of. I'll be back the following Sunday. I'll leave some house keys for you this Wednesday at school.

Izyy: Ok. Is Sparky a friendly dog? Is there anything else I need to know?

#### 60. Introduction and Practice of Help/Favor Pragmatics
Asking for help or a favor:
Asking for help:
1. Could you give me a hand? 
2. Can you help me please?
3. I could really use some help
4. think you can lend me a hand?

6. Please help me with this.

#### 61. Introduction to Presentation #2: Student Inventions
Day = Wednesday

Date = November 9, 2022

#### 62. Monday Class Activity #1: Compare/Contrast Pragmatics #3
Example Responses: (Izyy) (History, Vacation)

I think the saying, "History is written by the victors" is not completely true. 
Although most of history is written by a dominant culture of its time, 
there are many cases when alternate histories from other people still exist and influence even the dominant culture. 
For example, although the U.S. is 1 country right now, the peoples from the past have greatly shaped the entire country. 
This can be seen in place names. Many place names come from the people who lived there in the past: 
Native American tribes have places named after them: North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Cheyenne, etc. 
The French = Baton Rouge, etc. The Spanish = California, San Francisco, etc.
Although all these places are in the U.S., the place names, culture, dialect, and historical events tell of what really happened.
This doesn't just include the British version of what happened. 

#### 63. Monday: Class Activity #2: Class Discussion #10: Vacations 
Discussion Topic #10: Vacations (Think about and try to answer the following questions. Discuss with a partner)
How often do you take a vacation?
Where did you go for your best vacation? What did you do there?
Do you prefer to vacation for leisure or adventure? Why?
What was your worst vacation ever? Why?
Example Responses: (Izyy)

I don't go on vacations very often. I teach every semester, even summer. This means, I don't have many opportunities for a vacation. 
The last time I went on vacation was in 2019 before Covid.
I went to Europe with my brothers many years ago.
It was my best vacation because we traveled to 14 different countries and experienced many different things 
including many funny situations that made the whole trip memorable. It was like a comedy movie. 
We were trying to experience the most famous sights in every country. 
We visited a lot of museums, palaces, nature parks, and local sights.
I definitely go on vacation to experience something new. 
For me, I love going on adventures, exploring, experiencing something I have never done before. 
When I went to Australia in 2019, I was excited to hold a koala, feed kangaroos, and yes, even feed crocodiles. It was an exciting experience! 
The worst vacation I ever had was actually visiting Poland the year my mom had to get many official things done there.
It was so boring having to go from 1 government building to the next filling out paperwork, driving back and forth to different offices, 
and standing in line for hours. It was less a vacation, and more work really.

#### 64. Wednesday Class Activity #2: Group Activity Practice for Invention Presentation

### WEEK 12
#### 66. Introduction and Practice of Job Idioms
Idioms for Jobs
Here are some very common American English Idioms for "Jobs".

Job Idioms

1. A penny saved is a penny earned (expression): Saving money is just as important as earning money- we shouldn't spend it foolishly.
 Example: I’m worried about my sister’s spending habits. Whatever money she earns, she spends it all. I think she should save some of that money. A penny saved is a penny earned. That’s my belief.

2. All in a day’s work (noun phrase): If something is all in a day's work, it is nothing special.
Example:
Tina: You are so busy Carla! It’s amazing how much work you accomplish all day.

Carla: Oh that’s nothing. I do this every day. It’s all in a day’s work.

3. At the bottom of the totem pole (prepositional phrase): If someone is at the bottom of the totem pole, they are unimportant. Opposite is at the top of the totem pole.
Example: I don’t like my current position at work. I’m currently at the bottom of the totem pole as a clerk.

4. At the top of the totem pole (prepositional phrase): Someone at the top of the totem pole is in a high position of power, a very important person.
Example: The CEO of the company is at the top of the totem pole. I hope one day I will have his position.

5. back to the drawing board (prepositional phrase): If you have to go back to the drawing board, you have to go back to the beginning and start something again. Usually, this idiom is used when you try to do something in an experimental way, and it doesn’t work. You go back to the drawing board to rethink a different way to accomplish your goal.
Example: I tried making new pasta with thicker noodles, but that didn’t work, so I went back to the drawing board. This time, I’m going to make my pasta with thinner noodles.

6. Bad workers always blame their tools (expression): If somebody does a job badly or loses in a game and claims that they were let down by their equipment, you can use this to imply that this was not the case. What the person means is, you are not good at this. Your tools are only as good as you are.
Example: When my brother messed up building the patio, he claimed it was because he didn’t have the proper tools. I told him that bad workers always blame their tools. He was very upset that I would say that too him.

7. To beat someone to the draw (phrasal verb): If you beat someone to the draw, you do something before they do. This expression comes from the old west when gunfighters would challenge each other to a duel. The first one to pull out his gun and shoot would usually be the successful one. Currently, this idiom means when you compete with someone, the person who shows his/her idea to someone like their boss, usually wins.
Example: I have a very competitive co-worker. He’s always trying to share his ideas with the boss before me. One day, I want to beat him to the draw. Maybe then, my boss will take me more seriously.

8. To breathe down someone’s neck (phrasal verb): If someone follows you or examines what you're doing very closely, they are breathing down your neck.
Example: My boss didn’t like my report last month. Now, he follows me around the office all day. He’s breathing down my neck. I just hope he doesn’t fire me if something else goes wrong.

9. To bring something to the table (phrasal verb): If you bring something to the table, you make a contribution or an offer in a discussion or negotiation.
Example: The meeting last week was great because I remembered that I’m a carpenter, and my office needs a carpenter for the next job, so I talked to my boss and told him I had my carpentry skills to bring to the table.
Example Conversations:

Izyy: When I joined this company, I was at the bottom of the totem pole. Now, I am the general manager, so I am at the top of the totem pole.

Jason: Wow! That's nice Izyy. I left my last job because my boss was breathing down my neck all the time. I felt very uncomfortable.

Izyy: I trust you will do well here. You bring a lot of helpful skills to the table.

Jason: Thanks. At my last job my coworker liked to beat me to the draw on everything.

Izyy: Alright, I do hope you are not just a bad worker blaming their tools. 

Jason: I assure you, I am not. I work very hard and don't expect special treatment. It's all in a day's work.

Izyy: I hope so. I know you are not earning a very high salary right now, but a penny saved is a penny earned. Besides, you will receive a higher salary if you can prove to be a valuable worker. 

Jason: I always do my best, and if I don't get something right the first time, I always go back to the drawing board until I get it right.

Lina Liu
Nov 11, 2022Nov 11 at 5:01pm
My idioms: 1. breathing down my neck, 2. all in a day’s work3. bring something to the table

Conversation:

Julie: How’s your work going currently?

Mia: I am currently working almost 12 hours everyday, you know, I don’t like my work environment, because my boss is always breathing down my neck.

Julie: Relax, I think you need communicate with you boss ASAP, you know, as a manager, communicate to his team members is his all in a day’s work.

Mia: Agreed. I will talk to him next Monday and bring all of my feelings to the table.


#### 67. Monday Class Activity #1: Compare/Contrast Pragmatics #4
Example Responses: (Technology and The Future)

Technology: I think technology is growing and changing exponentially. 
(Math powers) It has been changing very quickly over the past 70 years, and I don't think it will slow down. 
Unless something disastrous happens, it will continue to change the world even before most people can catch up. 
I think this will mean, every older generation will have a harder and harder time to keep up with the latest changes and may feel very disconnected from the world. 
Although it is also possible that people will give up on technology if it outpaces what most people can adapt to and start a movement to bring people back to a slower, 
simpler time. I think Covid actually changed how we see the world today. 
Some people use more technology because of Covid while other people realized how lonely they felt when they couldn't contact people they cared about, 
and they decided to reconnect with people more. 
The Future: In the future, I think we WILL travel to other planets like Mars or even possibly Venus. 
Perhaps even moons like Europa or Io. I HOPE we have flying cars in the future because traffic these days is awful. 
Yes, I know that might cause some problems and not everyone today is a good driver, so they might not be good pilots, 
but I think our technology will be so good in the future, it can fly the cars for us. We can just enjoy the view. 
Having flying public transportation would be great too. Create hubs where people can fly in to work. Like the Jetsons.

### Week 13
#### 69. Introduction and Practice of Apologizing and Reconciling Pragmatics
Apologizing and Reconciling
Apologies are usually enough on their own when the offense is small. 
When the offense is more serious, we also try to add reconciliation of some kind to help the other 
person we offended feel better.

Apologizing:
I’m so sorry.
I didn’t mean to do that. Please forgive me.
I’m very sorry about that.
I’m so very sorry.
I’m sorry.
I apologize for that.
Please accept my sincere apologies.

Reconciling:
I promise I will never do that again. 
It will never happen again.
Please let me make it up to you.
Let me pay for you.
Let me take care of that for you.
Let me do something for you.
I really feel bad about this. Let me 
make it up to you somehow.

Example Responses: (Izyy)

(SMALL MISTAKE)

Izyy walks into Jason by mistake.

Izyy: Oh no! I'm sorry, Jason. I didn't mean to walk into you.

Jason: That's ok. Just be careful next time.

Izyy: I will.

(BIG MISTAKE)

Izyy breaks Jason's computer.

Izyy: Oh no! I'm so sorry Jason. I don't know what happened. Let me get this computer fixed for you. I'll give it back to you when I get it fixed.

Jason: Ok, but please hurry. I need my computer by the end of the week for classes.

Izyy: Ok, no problem.

#### 70. Introduction to Debates
Introduction to Pragmatics
What are pragmatics?
Pragmatics are a set of words or phrases that have a very specific use of sentence structure and grammar.
This sentence structure and grammar does not change
Pragmatics are used to be polite for many different situations
What are argumentative Pragmatics?
Argumentative pragmatics are used to politely argue in a debate
Why do we need to know argumentative pragmatics?
Because it is important to be able to argue for your ideas clearly and effectively
A basic debate has 3 parts:

Arguments = The debaters introduce all the main arguments for the topic they are arguing about. 
Each debater or group of debaters takes turns to introduce the main arguments for their side of the argument.
 

Disagreement = The debaters usually have a short time to think of specific arguments or points in an argument from the opposing side that they disagree with.
Please note, you cannot simply say you disagree with everything, you must disagree with specific points and try to provide evidence to show the opposite is true or disprove an argument. 
Each debater or debate team takes a turn disagreeing with 2-4 specific points.
 

Rebuttal = The debaters will have a short time to rethink which of the arguments for their side are the strongest and will then choose 2-3 arguments to restate. 
These are usually arguments that were not refuted (proven false) by the other side.
Usually, debaters will provide extra evidence to strengthen their main arguments.
Note that you CANNOT introduce new arguments at this stage of the debate. 
That would be unfair to the debate teams to receive new information at the end. 
However, you can restate any of the arguments your team finds strong from the first part of the debate.

#### 71.  Class Activity #1: Class Discussion #11: Work
Discussion Topic #11: Work (Think about and try to answer the following questions. Discuss with a partner)
What kind of job do you do?
Do you like your current job? Why or why not?
What is your dream job? Why?
What was the worst job you ever had? Why?
Example Responses: (Izyy)

I'm an ESL teacher.
I love my current job. I wanted to be a teacher for many years.
This is my dream job. I love being a teacher.
I think my worst job I ever had was a paper route. You had to get up very early in the morning, 
you were always in a hurry to deliver the newspapers on time, 
and the newspapers were sometimes so stinky that you felt sick to your stomach breathing in the ink.

Conversation 1 (SMALL MISTAKE)

Ava: Hey Eve, I’m so sorry I braked your lego house.

Eve: That's OK. You were only take apart of the roof, I will fixed ASAP, but try to be careful next time!

Example Conversation 2 (BIG MISTAKE)

Ava: Hey Jacky, I'm so sorry that I deleted your video game on my computer. I really feel bad about this. I installed a pretty new game for you and I promise it's an amazing game, let's play together.

Jacky: Oh, thank you for your apology. I was very sad that you deleted my video game. Thank you for the new game. You better not delete my video game next time or I might not play my favorite video game with you again.

Ava: I promise I will never do that again.  

### Week 14
#### 73. Introduction and Practice of Intonation and Stress Patterns
Words VS Meaning:
Many people believe that the words we use in language are important. This is true.
However, your intonation, and stress patterns may often say more than the words you use.
Watch the funny commercial below to get a better idea of how this works.
Notice that although both people use the same words, the way they use their stress 
and intonation are completely different and carry a very different message. The young girl is excited, while the man is angry.

 

What is stress?
Stress is emphasis/loudness over a part of a word or word in a sentence. That means you stress SOME words, but not others.

If you don't stress ANY words or EVERY word, your listener doesn't know what's important and what they should listen to.

What should you stress?
In general conversation and meaning, CONTENT words should be stressed.

What are content words?
Content words are MEANING words: Adjectives, Nouns, Verbs, and Adverbs. (interjections technically fit here) You can imagine these words. 
They carry meaning. Usually, 80% of the time, these words are stressed.

What words aren't usually stressed?
FUNCTION words are usually not stressed. Only 20% of the time when there is MISUNDERSTANDING will you stress function words.

What are function words?
Function words are grammar and structure words: Prepositions, Articles, Conjunctions, and Pronouns. 
These words have no meaning be themselves. Instead they help connect ideas together.

 

What is intonation?
Intonation is high or low pitch of your tone of voice. Each person has a natural intonation when they speak. 
Men usually have lower pitch while women usually have higher pitch; however, you can change the pitch of your voice to go up or down.

How can you use intonation?
You can use intonation to either RISE or FALL.

What does rising intonation mean?
It means that you DON'T know anything.

What does falling intonation mean?
It usually means that you KNOW something.

General Rules for Stress:
Stress content words when you speak: Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, and Adverbs.
Don't stress function words: prepositions, articles, pronouns, 
and conjunctions UNLESS there is some misunderstanding about the function words, then stress the function words that are misunderstood.
General Rules for Intonation:
At the end of a sentence, your intonation should FALL. You know something.
At the end of a yes/no question, your intonation should RISE. You don't know anything.
At the end of a WH- question, your intonation should FALL. You know something, but you want more detail.
At the end of a Tag question, your intonation should RISE if it's a true question,
but your intonation should FALL if you are looking for agreement from your listener.

https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cY1ufd5XEc

Intonation and Stress Patterns for Emotions:

Normal Emotion:
Stress content words
Intonation: Intonation should fall at end of sentence but rise at the end of yes/no question

Anger Emotion:
Stress content words or possessives, intonation should fall sharply on content words or possessives to emphasize anger

sadness emotions:
Don't stress any words, intonation should fall on content words and at end of sentence. you are depressed, you should show low energy

Excitement emotions:
Stress content words, Intonation should rise on content words to show excitement

Sarcasm emotions:
Stress the words that you want to joke about, using rising, falling, rising intonation on the word you want to show are part of your joke 
and mean the "opposite"

Examples: BLUE color = Stress
That is my ##car.  (FALL) (Normal)
That is ##my ##car.  (FALL) (Anger)
###That ###is ###my ###car. (FALL) (Sadness)
###That ###is ###my car. (RISE) (excitement)
That is my car. (RISE, FALL, RISE on "my") (sarcasm)

#### 74. Introduction and Practice of Advice Pragmatics
Example Responses:

1 = (YES)

Izyy: Hi Clara, can you please give me advice about where I should go for vacation?

Clara: Sure Izyy! I think you should go to Hawaii on vacation.

Izyy: Wow, Clara. That's a great idea. I'll do that.

2 = (MAYBE)

Izyy: Hi Clara, can you please give me advice about where I should move?

Clara: Sure. I think you should move to Ohio.

Izyy: Ohio? I've never been there. I'm not sure what kind of job I could get there. Let me think about it.

3 =(NO)

Izyy: Hi Clara, can you please give me advice about what pet I should buy?

Clara; Sure! I think you should buy an alligator as a pet.

Izyy: Oh really? I think alligators are dangerous. I'm not sure it's safe to keep one as a pet. I'll think it over.


#### 75. Debate #1: Can Money Buy You Happiness?
A basic debate has 3 parts:

Arguments = The debaters introduce all the main arguments for the topic they are arguing about. Each debater or group of debaters takes turns to introduce the main arguments for their side of the argument.
 

Disagreement = The debaters usually have a short time to think of specific arguments or points in an argument from the opposing side that they disagree with. Please note, you cannot simply say you disagree with everything, you must disagree with specific points and try to provide evidence to show the opposite is true or disprove an argument. Each debater or debate team takes a turn disagreeing with 2-4 specific points.
 

Rebuttal = The debaters will have a short time to rethink which of the arguments for their side are the strongest and will then choose 2-3 arguments to restate. These are usually arguments that were not refuted (proven false) by the other side. Usually, debaters will provide extra evidence to strengthen their main arguments. Note that you CANNOT introduce new arguments at this stage of the debate. That would be unfair to the debate teams to receive new information at the end. However, you can restate any of the arguments your team finds strong from the first part of the debate.

(Lina, only record part of the notes)  I agree with my group like Luz said, the #1 argument is that people are too busy working for money and are often unhappy. 
The first thing we need to figure out. What is happiness and how to get money? First, we need to make money. 
The harder you work, the happier you are. Is this true? I don't think so.
Is a person who is always working happier or a person who spends more time with family? 
The answer is clear. Family. Money is important to buy things, but true happiness comes with bonding.
What is happiness? Many people say, use money to buy something for making others happy. 
It isn't the money that makes you happy. The things you buy for others are what makes them happy. 
If we buy clothes for someone, it's the clothes that make you happy not the money you spent on them.
If you can be happy without money, then happiness is not based on money. 
A big house can make you happy? So buying a bigger house will make you happier? Probably not.
Sure, you can earn more money, but you spend less time with family and at your bigger house which you wanted. 
In general, I don't think money can buy happiness.

#### 79.Monday Class Activity #1: Compare/Contrast Pragmatics #5
Example Responses: (Success and The Future)

(Success)

I think many people have different ideas about what it means to be successful. 
For some people, success = having a very high paying job, big house, new car, and many material things that show high status.
Other people believe that success = a happy family and relationships spent with each other. 
I think I feel like I am somewhere in the middle about success. I think it's important to have a good job and earn good money for life, 
but I don't think you have to necessarily be rich to be happy. I also think good relationships between family, friends, and our community are important. 
Without other people, life can be quite sad and isolating.

(The future)

I really don't know what the future holds. 
It's interesting as a species that humans always look forward to the future with bright optimism even if things aren't looking so good. 
I guess it's our ability to imagine a better future. 
I think we need to remember the past, so that we don't repeat past mistakes in the future. 
We learn much faster in this way. Also, I've noticed as I get older, my perspective on the future has changed a lot. 
I'm no teenager any more who thinks that everything happening now is brand new. 
I realize for younger generations with less experience, that's how the world appears to them, 
but to someone older with more experience, the future often repeats the same patterns like in the past. 
The biggest difference is the details about HOW some trends and things happen. For example, in the past, 
I thought the fashion of my childhood was all brand new. 
My parents would remind me that fashion works on a cycle and often returns every few decades. 
Their generation wore "bell bottoms" and we wore "Flares". These are the same, just using different names. 
Polka dots were very popular when they were teens, and they were popular again when I was a teen. 
Things tend to repeat themselves in history. Now, I know that many things that happened in the past will probably repeat again. 
I find myself not as surprised as I was in the past. I can understand the patterns. 
Each generation also thinks they are smarter, cleverer, and will accomplish more than the past generation, 
but often they are simply repeating what happened before them.

#### 83. Monday Class Activity #2: Class Discussion #13: Culture
Discussion Topic #13: Culture (Think about and try to answer the following questions. Discuss with a partner)
Why is culture important?
What are some important things you want other people to know about your culture?
What is something that many people believe to be true about your culture but it is not true?
Do you participate in cultural events from your own culture? How often?
Do you participate in cultural events from other countries? How often?
Example Responses: (Teacher)

1. Culture is something that brings people together as a social group. 
2. People grow up in a specific culture with specific values and beliefs which keep the community together. 
3. That culture is shared and passed on to the next generation. It's important that it preserves a people's history.

4. I think each culture has something unique which it wants to share with the world whether that is a special tradition,
5. cultural event, belief, food, or lifestyle. Each culture can share these special things with each other and the world around them. Imparting wisdom and knowledge with others is important to human history.

6. There are many cultural stereotypes that exist in the world. 
7. I think the reason these exist is because we as humans often don't have much information about cultures other than our own and find easy ways and things that we learn about others and stick to them as being true. It is often not until we meet someone from a different culture when we find that those stereotypes are just general ideas, they aren't true about each person from that culture. People will vary within each culture.

8. I think that depends on how many immigrants from a certain culture are present. 
9. Larger populations of cultures tend to celebrate cultural events together. 
10. Where the community is small, there are not as many people or opportunities to celebrate important cultural events together.

11. I think we are all fascinated by other cultures and often try to participate in other cultural events when we see them. 
12. It's fun to learn something new about how other cultures live and why they celebrate certain things. 
13. We can compare our own traditions and see how they are alike and how they are different.

#### 84. Monday Class Activity #3: Compare/Contrast Pragmatics #6
Example Responses: (Izyy) (Planning + Home)

1. Planning: I love to plan everything. When I was very young, I was very disorganized. 
2. This caused many problems for me. I had trouble turning in homework on time because I often had to look for it in my messy backpack for a long time. 
3. I became very unhappy with my messy life. I decided to learn how to become very organized. 
4. It took me many years to learn how to organize everything and plan what to do. 
5. However, after I learned to become organized and started planning things out, my life became much easier.
6. I knew what I was doing and when I was doing it. It helped me create not only short plans for a week, 
7. but to try for long plans for my future.
8. I have been very happy to achieve many goals in my life because I became very organized and can adapt to different situations by changing, adjusting, or creating different plans.
9. I suppose one bad thing about being a planner is that I can't be very spontaneous. 
10. I am not good at doing something at a specific moment. 

11. Home: Home is a very important idea for most people. In today's world, I think it's difficult to find "home". To me, home does NOT = house. A house is a place where you live. A home is a place where you feel safe, comfortable, and loved. It is your sanctuary. A home can be found even if it is not in a specific place. You can feel like home being surrounded by the people you love and who love you. Wherever those people are, that's where your home is. I think it's harder to find home today because of the technology we have. The internet, cell phones, the use of personal cars makes the world feel like a big, lonely place many times. We don't see as many people face-to-face anymore either. It can feel very lonely when we are not in direct contact with someone we love. On the other hand, the internet can directly connect us with family and friends who are half a world away. 

#### 85. Final Presentation: Dream Vacation
You must answer the following questions about your vacation:
What is your dream vacation?
Why is that your dream vacation?
How long would you like to go there to visit?
What would you like to do there?
Who would go with you on this vacation? Why?
Above all, have fun! This presentation should be a fun experience.
Grading:

You will be graded on your presentations according to accuracy, fluency, time limit, and good eye contact with the audience.

Date of Final Presentation: Final Presentation will happen ONLINE through Zoom, Wednesday December 7, 2022 at 1PM.

#### 3. idioms: https://www.eslcafe.com/resources/idioms/

#### 4. Formal vs. Informal Speech
https://youtu.be/zbKLghk2eFg
Have you ever thought about the difference between "Hello" and "Hi"?  "Hello" is slightly more formal in English.
If you go to a job interview or your first day of work, you would say "Hello" to the people there--not "Hi." 
With your close friends, you would say "Hi."  For classmates and people in public, it can get a bit tricky.  
California tends to be less formal than many other states, so saying "Hi" to your teacher or classmates is acceptable.
The first time you meet someone or send them an email, you should use "Hello" and then see how they answer back.  
Once the other person uses "Hi," it's usually okay to use "Hi" with them after that.
In addition to our word choice, there are other differences between formal and informal speech. 
There's nothing wrong with sounding formal, but sometimes it seems a bit unusual.  
Even when we are in formal situations, we don't pronounce all of the sounds in English.  
This is a great video that shows you how to sound more natural.

#### 5. Introduce Yourself
1) What name do you prefer to go by?  ("To go by" is an idiom that means to be called a certain name.)
2) What brought you to DVC?  
   1) ("What brought you" or "What brings you" is an idiom that means what are your reasons for doing something?)
3) What's something you like about US culture?
4) What's something you don't like about US culture?
5) What's something you like about your home culture?
6) Add anything else you want to tell the class.

#### 6. Pronouns and Possessive Adjectives
https://youtu.be/3QsEXs1G_00

### Unit 3
#### 7. Phrasal verbs
Phrasal verbs are verbs that are made of more than one word.  
There is usually a root to a main verb and then an extra word or words that completely change the meaning of the root word.  
For example, the word hang means this:
But when "hang" is joined with other small words, the meaning changes. 
Here are some examples:
hang up
hang out
https://www.eslcafe.com/resources/phrasal-verbs

#### 8. The -tion Noun Ending
By now, you probably know that many nouns end in -tion in English.  Here are a few helpful hints about the -tion ending.
I.  Most -tion nouns in English are a combination of a verb + the -tion ending.  Here are some examples:
      subtract + -tion = subtraction
      vacate  + -tion = vacation
      explain + -tion = explanation   (Sometimes there is a spelling change.)

II.  The syllable before the -tion is almost always the stressed syllable.  Let's look at and listen to our example words:
     subtraction = sub-TRAK-shun
     vacation = vei-KEI-shun
     explanation = ex-pla-NEI-shun

#### 9. How to Introduce Yourself
https://youtu.be/oWP9Riq-ZBg

### Unit 4
#### 10. Pronunciation Practice: schwa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syX-07rhxoE
In some of our pronunciation videos, you may have heard the word "schwa." 
The word "schwa" is very strange.  If you ask a native speaker what it means, they probably won't know, 
but it is the most common sound in American English.
Watch this video to learn more about the all-important schwa!
Schwa happens in unstressed syllables.
The syllable is reduced and said quickly.
Schwa is relaxed.  (Kind of like "uh.")  There is no tension.
Any vowel letter can be the schwa sound.

#### 11. Vocabulary #1: Using a Thesaurus
Many people believe that using a dictionary will help them increase their vocabulary--well, maybe. 
But there's a better tool to help remind you of the words you already know and to teach you new words.
That tool is a thesaurus.  A dictionary gives you a definition, but a thesaurus gives you a list of words that are similar. 
The similar words are called synonyms.
You can use a book called a thesaurus, but there's a perfectly good website called, simply, 
Thesaurus.com Links to an external site.
https://www.thesaurus.com/

#### 12. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 1, what a syllable is?
Many students worry about pronouncing individual sounds, but word stress is more important than pronouncing sounds exactly. 
But before we focus on word stress, we have to remember what a syllable is.

Watch this for a quick review of what a syllable is. 
https://youtu.be/sqHRA5_AreY
Stressed syllables receive emphasis and full pronunciation; they are often louder.
The number of vowel sounds within a word determines the number of syllables.

#### 13. Verb Endings (Suffixes)
Verbs can be tricky in English.  Sometimes they have suffixes; sometimes they don't.  
It helps to learn some common verb suffixes because you can identify and learn new verbs by recognizing these suffixes and how they are usually pronounced.
Here are some common verb endings and some examples with them. 
(The usual stress pattern is shown, but, of course, with English, there are many exceptions.)
https://youtu.be/qwrw5OUwRbk

#### 14. Speaking Introducing Yourself 
We often have to introduce ourselves, and no matter how many times we do it, for many people, it can make us nervous. 
One of the best practices for feeling more comfortable speaking is practice. 
If you have a formalized introduction of yourself that you have written and practiced, 
then when you are asked to introduce yourself, you will feel more confident.
This will come in handy when you are at a job interview.
This is a speaking assignment, but if it helps you to write it out first and then read it, that's fine. 
For this assignment, speak for two minutes introducing yourself.
Because this is practice for an interview, we'll begin with the word "Hello" rather than "Hi." 
Be sure to tell your me your name and where you're from.  This could be your home country or where you live now.
Consider the following questions, but also add anything you think is interesting or useful to know about you:
What is your work experience?
What is your education experience?
What special skills do you have?  (Don't forget that you are bilingual.  That is extremely valuable!)
What hobbies do you have?
What goals do you have?

### Unit 5
#### 15. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 2
https://youtu.be/XASBN5uMdEk
Stressed syllables receive emphasis and full pronunciation; they are often louder and last longer. 
(Helpful tip:  For words ending in -ion, the stress is almost always on the syllable right before the ion. 
For example, information =  in-fer-MEI-shuhn.)

#### 16. Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 1
Here's a good one.  Be sure to watch the whole thing!  (No, there won't be a quiz on this, but be sure not to skip over this--"r" is the hardest sound to make in English.)

(This sound can also be found on the American IPA Chart Links to an external site.as the "r" for "rabbit.")
https://americanipachart.com/
https://youtu.be/3XRTN5gW4oU

#### 17. Word Forms: Adjectives
The phrases "word forms" and "suffixes" are closely related.  Word forms tell us the part of speech of a word. 
Suffixes are word endings that tell us the part of speech of a word.  Not all words in English have suffixes. 
Many nouns and verbs do not.  However, many adjectives and adverbs do.

Please watch this video on word forms.  It covers the suffixes for several parts of speech. 
(Ignore any references to a book.  It was made when I still used books for my classes.  Also, ignore the unit number.)  
In this unit, we will be focusing on adjectives.

https://youtu.be/-6fomRuV_z0
https://youtu.be/R4vl1H0vdK4

### Unit 6
#### 18. Pronunciation Practice: "o" as in "Rose"
"O" is a sound that most of you have in your native language.  
Did you know that in English, the "o" sound is actually two vowel sounds together? 
We don't just say "o" in English--we say "o" with a rounded "u" sound at the end. 
Working on this sound will help you with clarity in many of your words.

https://youtu.be/w7O08xhdH0Q

### 19. Pronunciation Practice: Word Stress, Part 3
https://youtu.be/dQ4rUdsh_hQ
https://www.merriam-webster.com/
https://www.dictionary.com/
Here are two good online dictionaries:  Meriam Webster  site.and Dictionary.com . 
Type in any word (like "apple") and notice how they show the syllable stress in different ways.

### 20. Word Forms: Adverbs
Word forms tell us the part of speech of a word. Suffixes are word endings that tell us the part of speech of a word.
Not all words in English have suffixes.
Many nouns and verbs do not. However, many adjectives and adverbs do.

One of the easiest suffixes to remember is the most common suffix for adverbs: -ly. 

Now that we know the form of adverbs and some exceptions, it helps to know what an adverb is! 
An adverb can have one of these three functions:
1). it modifies a verb
2). it modifies an adjective
3). it modifies another adverb.

I remember this by looking at the word "adverb" itself. 
First, there is the "ad" at the beginning of the word--that reminds me that adverbs can modify adjectives.
Then I look at the end of the word "verb"--that's an easy one; that reminds me that adverbs can modify verbs.
Then I look at the whole word--"adverb"--and that reminds me that adverbs can modify verbs.
Here some example sentences:

He is extremely tall.              (Here, "extremely" is an adverb modifying the adjective "tall.")
He walks slowly.                    (Here, "slowly" is an adverb modifying the verb "walks.")
He walks very slowly.           (Here, "very" is an adverb modifying the adverb "slowly.")

https://youtu.be/L0USJe44yS4

### 21. Optional Practice for Unit 6
A.   Are you good at grammar?  How does grammar make you feel?  Are you good at it in your native language?  What are some of the challenges of learning English grammar?  How important do you think grammar is in communication?

B.   Have you been to any other states in the US?  If so, what was your experience like there?  If you haven't been to any other states, what other states do you know about?  What is your impression of those states?

C.  Pronunciation Practice:  Rose "o"

D.  Pronunciation Practice:  Word Stress, Part 3

### 22. Review of Unit #6

the "r" in "purple shirt."
https://youtu.be/eRoL9YJa0lQ
bird work concur reverse over teacher mother her later perhaps turn stir journey

#### 25. Pronunciation Practice: Intonation
There are a few terms in pronunciation that are often confused.  These are "stress," "tone," and "intonation." 
In simple terms, here are their definitions:
1). Stress refers to syllable stress in a word, meaning how long and how loud the syllable is said.
2). Tone refers to the pitch of a word or syllable, meaning how high or low the word or syllable is said.
3). Intonation refers to the pitch of words across a sentence, such as whether certain words or syllables rise or fall.
Here are two great videos that demonstrate intonation for questions and clarification.
https://youtu.be/Aoj4HZlLQBY
https://youtu.be/GFwxtdhNZJw
Did you go to the party? /What did you bring to the party? /Did you pick up the groceries? /Does the store open at one?
Can you lend me a dollar? /How are you? /Why did you leave? /Where are the keys? /Who are you calling? /Which one did you buy?
Can I borrow your book? /Where's your book? /Did you go to the show? /How was the show? /Did you see Amanda? /When did you see Amanda?
What? /Pardon? /I beg your pardon? /I'm sorry? /I'm sorry. /Come again. /I didn't understand.  Could you repeat that? /I didn't catch that.

#### 26. Word Order: SVOMPT
You've probably heard that the word order in English is the following:  Subject + Verb + Object.  We sometimes abbreviate that to SVO.  
There's even more to word order than that.  Have you heard of SVOMPT?  It stands for Subject + Verb + Object + Manner (how) + Place + Time.
https://youtu.be/4q3ohLRTHa8

#### 27. Optional Practice for Unit 7
A.   Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are big celebrations in the US.

Do you have any US holidays that you enjoy?  If so, what are they and why?
B.   After looking at your personal discussion board, 
do you agree with the points that I posted there regarding the areas you need to work on so far? 
Were you able to find the resources and videos on your personal discussion board?  Have you watched them already?  
Do you feel you need more resources to continue improving?  Where would you find those resources?
C.  Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 2
D.  Pronunciation Practice: Intonation

### Unit 8
#### 29. Pronunciation Practice: silver "i"
Here's a sound that most of you probably do not have in your language. 
It is often confused with green "e" and takes a while to master.  It is a very relaxed sound, so be sure to relax your mouth!
https://youtu.be/Oqgpxz4fXEI
"elbow grease"
After a bit of elbow grease, my kitchen shine and sparkle again.
#### 30. Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 3
https://youtu.be/WMkrolnBMPg

#### 31. Simple Present
Do you know the top five most common errors of non-native speakers?  You probably won't be surprised to know what they are:
1). articles
2). prepositions
3). subject-verb agreement with third person in simple present
4). verb form
5). word choice
We're going to focus now on the one that happens every day--#3--the missing "s" on the simple present verb with the third person.
The main uses of the simple present:
to express something that happens regularly:
      I always eat breakfast.         She eats a lot of candy.
to express a fact:
       Omnivores eat meat and plants.
       Vegetarians don't eat meat.
to speak about a movie, book, or story:
       Romeo loves Juliet.
       Shakespeare writes, "Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it."

The simple present IS NOT expressed when speaking about "right now."
Right now, I am taking an ESL class.   (Not:  Right now, I take an ESL class.)

#### 32: Voiced and Voiceless Sounds
https://youtu.be/XNrloK1KA0c
All sounds in English are either voiced or voiceless.  "Voiced" means that your throat vibrates when you make the sound; 
"voiceless" means that your throat doesn't vibrate when you make the sound. 
You can feel the vibration by touching your throat or the top of your head when you make the sound.

There are more sounds in the English language than there are in the alphabet, 
but here is a rough guide for which sounds are voiced and which are voiceless:
First, all vowels are voiced:  a, e, i, o, and u.

#### 33: Pronunciation Practice: "s" endings
When we use the "s" on the simple present tense third-person singular verbs (for "he," "she," "it," and other singular nouns), 
the "s" sound follows the same rule as it does for other words.
There are three ways to pronounce the final "s" sound, whether it's on verbs or other parts of speech:
1). "s"
2). "z"
3). "ihz"
For "s" before voiceless letters, the sound is a pure "s" sound.
For "s" before voiced letters, the sound is a pure "z" sound.
For "s" before other sounds that are like "s," the sound is an "ihz" sound.  (Like silver "i" with a "z.")

Here are some verbs for each category:
eats, lacks, helps, laughs
plays, loves, begs, smells
kisses, sneezes, catches, washes
https://youtu.be/hde9Sg75Nn4

#### 34. Pronunciation Practice: Contractions
You may hear that you should not use contractions in English. That is absolutely incorrect!  
We use contractions all the time in our speaking.  It used to be that you couldn't use them in your academic writing, but even that rule is changing.  
For now, avoid contractions in your writing, but do use them in speaking.  You will sound much more natural in your speaking if you do.
What are contractions?  They are the shortening of two words by combining them.  
When we combine them, we delete at least one letter and replace it with an apostrophe in writing.
Here is a clear explanation, and below it are some common examples. 
These examples include some that are accepted in writing and some that are not.  
They are all accepted in speaking.
https://youtu.be/MzhjD-XrYjg

#### 35. Optional Practice for Unit 8
A.   Do you feel that the three-branch system of the United States is fair? 
Why or why not?  What is the system of government in your home country like?  
Do you think it is fair?  Why or why not?
B.   Pronunciation Practice: silver "i"
C.  Pronunciation Practice: "r," Part 3
D.  Pronunciation Practice: "s" endings
E.  Pronunciation Practice: Contractions

### Unit 9
#### 37. Pronunciation Practice: black "a"
Here is a sound that may not exist in your native language.  
(If your native language is Persian, you can probably make this sound easily because it is one of the few languages like English that has this sound.)
This sound is often called "short a," but it is better described as the "a" in "black cat" on The Color Vowel Chart Links to an external site..
black "a" (not "red" and not "olive")
1). Drop your jaw!
2). Pull back your lips (like you're smiling!)
https://youtu.be/QJd5c1T1t-w
"hand in"separable :The first thing I need to do after I wake up this morning is hand in my Phrasal Verbs # 3 homework, because I forgot to finished it last night.

#### 38. Pronunciation Practice: "th"
"th":  This is probably the third hardest sound to make!  
Here's Keenyn again in a great video on how to pronounce "th" in English 
(but I disagree with how she pronounces "with"--I think it should be voiced.)
https://youtu.be/BBSU6A-CRx0

#### 39. Simple Present Negative Sentences with "Be"
To form negative sentences in the simple present tense with "to be" verbs, we simply add the word "not."  
We can shorten this by using contractions.  (Notice how the "I" contraction form is different from the others.)
Clear here to practice this form:
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-simple-exercise-10.html

#### 40. Simple Present Negative Sentences with Other Verbs
To form negative sentences in the simple present tense with other verbs, we need "not" and the helping verb "do."
We can shorten these, also, by using contractions. 
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-simple-exercise-3.html
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-simple-exercise-4.html

#### 41. Pronunciation Practice: "Not" Contractions
We use "not" contractions all the time, so work on mastering these sounds to sound more natural.
https://youtu.be/AiFAXX08ffM

#### 42. Optional Practice for Unit 9
A.   Did you know previously about the Electoral College?  
Some people in the US support it while others strongly disagree with it. 
What is your opinion?  Do you think we should keep it or get rid of it?

### Unit 10
#### 44. Pronunciation Practice: mustard "u"
Mustard "u," Links to an external site.often called short "u," is a very common sound in English.

#### 52. Pronunciation Practice: "w" vs. "v"
Here's a great video on "w" vs. "v."  For "w," remember that the teeth do not touch the lips.  For "v," they do.
https://youtu.be/7PavwYaxcZA

#### 53.Grammar: Simple Past Tense
"Be" Verbs with Positive Sentences

The simple past tense is similar to the simple present tense because 
it has different rules for the verb "be," which becomes "was" or "were."
Here's how to make the positive with the "be" verb:
I was cold/you were tired./He was in the garden./She was late./It was sunny./We were on vacation/
They were hungry./

Other Verbs with Positive Sentences:
We usually make the positive by adding "-ed'"to the infinitive. For example, "play" becomes "played." However,
there are some irregular verbs Links to an external site..   For example, "go" becomes "went" and "run" becomes "ran."

#### 54. Pronunciation Practice: -ed Endings
o form the simple past tense, we add -ed to regular verbs. 
Since this isn't a grammar class, we won't go into all of the exceptions with irregular verbs.

However, that -ed rule can still be confusing because there are three ways to pronounce the -ed ending. 
We need to understand two ideas:  one is voicing; the other is a syllable.  We've already gone over voicing.  
You probably have learned about syllables, but watch the first video below for a review, and then watch the second video to understand how the -ed endings are pronounced.
https://youtu.be/sqHRA5_AreY
Here's a great video about how to pronounce -ed endings.  Be sure not to skip over this. 
Our second quiz will be on -ed endings.  This is a very common error with non-native speakers.
https://youtu.be/SjKqgujaeWE
RULES for -ed endings:

1) If a verb ends in a "t" or "d" sound and you add -ed, then there is an extra syllable that sounds like "did."
     shift --> shifted (shif-did)
     end   --> ended (en-did)
     avoided --> a/voi/did  (3 syllables)
2) If a verb ends in a vowel sound or a voiced consonant sound, then it ends in a -d sound with no extra syllable.
play --> played (Both words are one syllable.)    

love --> loved (Both words are one syllable.)
3) If a verb ends in a voiceless consonant sound, then it ends in a  -t sound with no extra syllable.
 wash --> washed (washt)   (one syllable)

#### 55. Keeping a Conversation Going
Do you find that you are more shy in English than in your native language?  That's a very common experience for many people.  
This video covers a tool for how to keep a conversation going:  asking open-ended questions rather than yes-no questions. 
Keep this in mind because we will have some practice on this in the next unit.

#### 59. Simple Past Negative Sentences with Other Verbs
To form negative sentences in the simple past tense with other verbs, 
we need "not" and the helping verb "did." What's nice is with the simple past, all negative verbs take "did."  
We can shorten these, also, by using contractions.

#### 63. Vocabulary #4: Prefixes
We've learned about suffixes, which can tell us the part of speech in English.  
Now we'll learn some common prefixes.
Prefixes are pieces of words that appear at the beginning.  
They don't tell us the part of speech.  Rather, they change the meaning of words.
Step 1:  Listen to and watch the video.  (20 minutes, 18 seconds)
Step 2:  For practice, repeat each word after you hear it in the video.
Step 3:  Write the meaning for each of the prefixes listed below. (Please number them 1 through 32.)

#### 64. Simple Past Questions with "Be"
To make a question in the simple past, just like the simple present, 
we change the position of "was" or "were" and the subject.

Here are the simple past "yes/no" questions with "be":
Was I sleepy?
Were you late?
Was he at the movies?
Was she kind?
Was it hot?
Were we hungry?
Were they at work?
With the "wh'" questions with "be," the question word just goes at the beginning, and everything else is the same.
Why was I sleepy?
Where were you?
When was he at the movies?
How was she?
How was it?
Why were we hungry?
When were they at work?

#### 65. Politely Disagreeing
Have you ever been stuck in a conversation without knowing how to disagree with someone politely?  
Now you will read a list of ways to disagree with someone
Choose two of your favorite ways from the list that you think you would like to use in the future. 
All you need to do is copy two appropriate sentences or phrases from the list.

https://www.speakconfidentenglish.com/disagree-in-english/
The most polite way to disagree with someone is to use one of these strategies when 
introducing your disagreement:
 show that you understand the other person’s opinion
 
apologize before introducing your disagreement

 pretend to be in the middle or unsure about your position
Using these strategies helps to soften the disagreement and make your position or 
argument more effective. 
 I see what you’re saying but I think...

 I respect your point but from my perspective (or but in my opinion)...

 I take your point but that isn’t the way I see it; instead, I think that...
 
True, that is a fair point, but I have to say I disagree...

 I understand where you are coming from but...

 There is some truth to what you’re saying but don’t you think that...
 
I’m sorry but I have to disagree with you on...
 
I’m not sure I agree with you on...
 
I don’t think you and I have the same opinion on this issue.

I’m afraid I disagree.

I’m sorry but I don’t agree.

I don’t see it that way.

I’m sorry but I disagree with you on this.

I respectfully disagree.

I have a completely different opinion on that.

#### 67. Pronunciation Practice: gray "a"
Here is a common sound that may exist in your native language. 
It's often called "long a," but it is better described as the "a" in "gray day" on The Color Vowel Chart Links to an external site.. 
It is a diphthong--which is a fancy word that means "two vowels together"--so it sounds more like "ei."

#### 68. Group Discussion Unit 14
Consider the two sentences below.  Which sentence do you agree with, and why? 
Write two to three sentences explaining your opinion.  
I'll go first with my opinion.  (You do not have to agree with me!)
A)  Kindness is more important than honesty.
B)  Honesty is more important than kindness.

Teacher's answer:
I believe honesty is more important than kindness.  Although I believe kindness is very important,
I would rather know the truth about something and make my own decision rather than have someone hide it from me. 
I believe that even when news is bad, we can deliver it kindly to someone.
Lina's answer:
I believe honesty is more important than kindness. 
I believe honesty is the top foundation of the trust and honest is the most important characteristics in creating strong relationships with others. 
I can totally trust in another person if our relationship is based on honesty. 
I believe being honesty means self-respect and respect for truly friends. 
Although kindness is also important to us, but honesty is the basic foundation, and without the basic foundation, kindness is meaningless.

Linking is my favorite skill to teach because I believe it is the greatest skill you can acquire to improve your fluency and pronunciation.  
When you first hear about linking, it sounds very strange. 
It takes practice; however, it will not only improve your speaking skills but your listening comprehension skills as well.
Watch this video to learn about linking, and we'll start with the first kind of linking:  consonants to vowels

Last week you considered two value-based statements.  Now we will get a bit more controversial.
Consider the two sentences below.  Which sentence do you agree with, and why?  
Write at least two to three sentences explaining your opinion.  
I know each sentence has many points to discuss, so discuss those points!
A)  The government should raise taxes to spend more money on helping people.
B)  The government should lower taxes on people and companies to stimulate the economy.

Lina Liu
Nov 26, 2022Nov 26 at 12:18pm
I agree with sentence B), because currently we experience economic weakness in 2022. 
So our government need to lower taxes to stimulate the economy by boosting spending. 
I believe what our government need to do first is to lower the personal income taxes to encourage individuals to work, save, and invest. 
And lower taxes will ultimately lead to a larger economy.  
And only after our economy speed up and economy grow in an idea level, we can consider sentence A), 
currently sentence B) is more suitable for our society.

Read these eleven ways to interrupt someone politely,
and then copy one here that you want to try the next time you are in this situation.
11 Ways to Interrupt Someone Politely in English
(from Speak Confident English:  link to site)
When you need to deliver a message:
I hate to interrupt, but I wanted to let you know I have to leave the meeting early.
I’m so sorry to interrupt, but...
I don’t mean to be rude, but may I interrupt quickly?
 
When you need to end a conversation
I’m terribly sorry to interrupt you, but I have to be at work for a meeting shortly 
and must *get going*. It was wonderful to see you. Have a nice day. (Note: In this 
context, to get going means to depart or leave.)
Oh! Sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed the time, and I need to get to work. I’m 
very sorry. But it was great chatting with you.
When you need to ask a question or would like to clarify something:
Sorry to interrupt, but may I ask a quick question?
I’m so sorry for interrupting, but I’d like to make sure I understood you correctly.
I don’t mean to be rude, but I’d like to ask a question.
 
When you want to join a conversation or express your opinion:
So sorry to interrupt, but before we *move on*, I’d like to add my thoughts on this 
topic. (Note: to move on means to start doing or discussing something new.)
Excuse me, but may I jump in here?
May I add something quickly?

### Unit 16
#### 78. The End of the Semester!
This is our last unit of the semester, so you're probably wondering what happens next.
Our last day of class is technically this Friday, December 9.  I will have just two business days to turn in grades, 
so if there is something you want to turn in or re-do, you have until Tuesday, December 13, at 11:59 PM to do so.  After that, it is out of my hands.
If you are in the credit class, I will email you with your grade.  If you have an "A," there is nothing else you need to do.  
If you have less than an "A," I will give you suggestions for how to raise your grade.
If you are in the non-credit class, you will not be receiving a grade. 
Remember that you can take this class again next semester or choose to move on to ESL-95.
You will have access to the Canvas course until January 9, so feel free to download any of your work or the material in the course up until that date.  
This would be a good time to look at your personal discussion board again and download any resources that will help you for the next classes you take.
On a side note, my computer had some issues this weekend, so I couldn't post the last quiz.  
As a result, there are only three quizzes for this class.  I hope that means good news for you!
As always, let me know if you have any questions.
I've enjoyed working with you and hope that you have a peaceful winter break!

#### 79. Linking Vowels to Vowels
If you thought linking consonants to vowels was weird, wait till you hear this:  linking vowels to vowels. 
But trust me--this will help you sound more like a native speaker, speak faster, read faster, and understand native speakers better.

https://youtu.be/BxZjJLichuY
This is easier when you see a consonant linked before a vowel.

I ate a lot of apples.
During that time, many churches, homes, black businesses were bombed. 
It was like part of life.  It was a part of living and growing up in the South.  
But when I heard about the shooting in the church in South Carolina, I began to shake, I began to cry.  
It just came out of me because it stays within you.  And it's almost like here is this link, another link of, ah, death.  
And the question is when will we break this link?

#### 80. Future Tense: Part 1
Now that we are at the end of the semester, it's fitting that we look ahead to the future by looking at the future tense.
Did you know there are three common ways to express the future tense in English?  
We'll look at the first way first:  using "will."
This may be the first form taught, but keep in mind that it is not the most common.  
This form is used for expressing promises.  We can also use "be + going to" for the future tense.  
"Be + going to" is for a plan, not a promise.  For example, if someone asked me, 
"What are your doing this weekend?" I would say, "I'm going to visit my cousins" because that is my plan.  
However, if my mother asks me, "When are you going to do your homework?" I would say,
"I will do it right now" because I am promising her.  We can also use "will" if we are very sure about the future.

Here's the positive form for a promise (it's just "will"+ the base form):
Positive Form	Contracted Form
I will meet him later.	I'll meet him later.
You will come.	You'll come.
It will be ready on time.	It'll be ready on time.
She will be there.	She'll be there.
He will help us.	He'll help us.
We will get married soon.	We'll get married soon.
They will cook dinner.	They'll cook dinner.

The short form, 'll, is very, very common and is almost always used when speaking. 
It's really much more natural to say "I'll" instead of "I will."  
Here's some help with the pronunciation of "we'll":
https://youtu.be/jTfPWknbm7A

Next, here's the negative form (just add "not"; for the contraction, "will not" becomes "won't"):
Negative Form	Contracted Form
I will not meet him later.	I won't meet him later.
You will not come.	You won't come.
It will not be ready on time.	It won't be ready on time.
She will not be there.	She won't be there.
He will not help us.	He won't help us.
We will not get married soon.	We won't get married soon.
They will not cook dinner.	They won't cook dinner.

Here's a tip on how to pronounce "won't."
https://youtu.be/Z8zVS8S7s28
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future-exercise-1.html

Finally, here's the question form for yes/no questions:
Will I go?
Will you come early?
Will it be cold?
Will she dance?
Will he arrive soon?
Will we cook?
Will they leave?
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future-exercise-2.html

And for "wh" questions:
Where will I go?
Why will you come early?
When will it be cold?
Who will she dance with?
What time will he arrive?
What will we cook?
When will they leave?
https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future-exercise-3.html

#### 81. Future Tense: Part 2
More common than the "will" form of the future tense is the use of "be + going to + base form."  
This is used when we are speaking in general about a plan or intention for the future.
Here's the positive form for a plan or intention (it's just "going to"+ the base form):
Positive Form	Contracted Form
I am going to meet him later.	I'm going to meet him later.
You are going to come.	You're going to come.
It is going to be ready on time.	It's going to be ready on time.
She is going to be there.	She's going to be there.
He is going to help us.	He's going to help us.
We are going to get married soon.	We're going to get married soon.
They are going to cook dinner.	They're going to cook dinner.

The words "going to" in speaking are said very quickly and sound like "gonna."  
Be careful--do not write "gonna"--but do say it.  Here is a video that explains the pronunciation.
https://youtu.be/nptBj44Aj7A

Next, here's the negative form (just add "not"; for the contraction):
Negative Form	Contracted Forms
I am not going to meet him later.	I'm not going to meet him later.
You are not going to come.	
You're not going to come.  OR
You aren't going to come.
It is not going to be ready on time.	It's not going to be ready on time.   OR
It isn't going to be ready on time.
She is not going to be there.	
She's not going to be there.       OR
She isn't going to be there.
He is not going to help us.	
He's not going to help us.     OR
He isn't going to help us.
We are not going to get married soon.	
We're not going to get married soon.  OR
We aren't going to get married soon.
They are not going to cook dinner.	
They're not going to cook dinner.     OR
They aren't going to cook dinner.

Finally, here's the question form for yes/no questions:
Am I going to go?
Are you going to come early?
Is it going to be cold?
Is she going to dance?
Is he going to arrive soon?
Are we going to cook?
Are they going to leave?

And for "wh" questions:
Where am I going to go?
Why are you going to come early?
When is it going to be cold?
Who is she going to dance with?
What time is he going to arrive?
What are we going to cook?
When are they going to leave?

practice when to use "will" and when to use "be + going to."

#### 82. Future Tense: Part 3
About as common as "be + going to+ base form" for the future tense is the use of the present progressive (or present continuous).  
This is also used when we are speaking in general about a plan or intention for the future.
Here's the positive form for a plan or intention using the present progressive/continuous:
Positive Form	Contracted Form
I am meeting him later.	I'm meeting him later.
You are coming tomorrow.	You're coming tomorrow.
It is raining tomorrow.	It's raining tomorrow.
